Additionally, each has \"minor gods\" to select from every time the player advances an age, with all deities granting the player unique technologies, perks, myth units and God powers that are used to damage or benefit players. There are three types of base unit – humans, heroes and myth units, the latter two being mythical figures or creatures from the historical civilization\u0027s mythology and legends. A rock-paper-scissors model governs which units are best suited against others; for example, humans are good against heroes but weak against myth units. Every unit also has a sub-category such as heavy infantry or archers, again with each being better suited against certain others. Human units include hoplites or chariot archers, heroes include Odysseus and Ramesses, and myth units include Cyclopes and giants. \n \nThe Campaign is divided into 8 scenarios for all three civilizations, set into separate campaigns, the first one, the Egyptian one focuses of Hatshepsut and her father Thutmose defeating Set\u0027s son Setekh, after investigating bandit raids near Memphis.",

Players can create their own athletes, starting in Backyard Football (1999). Another aspect of the games is the use of Power-Ups, allowing players to gain \"super-abilities.\" For instance, \"Super Dunk\" allows a basketball player to make an incredible dunk from nearly anywhere on the court, \"Leap Frog\" allows a football player to jump over the entire defensive line, and \"Ice Cream Truck\" causes the other team to be completely distracted for a brief period of time.",

    "summary": "Band Hero is a spinoff video game as part of the Guitar Hero series of music rhythm games, released by Activision on November 3, 2009, for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii and Nintendo DS consoles. The game is structurally similar to Guitar Hero 5, and supports full band play (lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals) including the drop-in/drop-out and in-song instrument and difficulty change menus, and additional multiplayer modes as Guitar Hero 5. The console versions use instrument-shaped game controllers, while the DS version uses either the \"Guitar Grip\" introduced with the Guitar Hero: On Tour series or a new Drum Skin that comes with the game. Like previous games, virtual avatars of Taylor Swift, Adam Levine, and the band No Doubt are presented in the game. \n \nBand Hero received mixed reviews from journalists. Some considered the game to be an appropriately flavored version of Guitar Hero 5 for the \"Top 40\" pop rock hits, while others felt the game was strictly aimed at teenagers. They also contested the cost of the full game, featuring only 65 songs compared with 85 songs in Guitar Hero 5, and considered if the content would have been better in downloadable form. A day after the game\u0027s release, the band No Doubt sued Activision, citing similar misuse of their avatars as the Kurt Cobain avatar in Guitar Hero 5.",

    "storyline": "The story of Disgaea opens with Laharl rising out of an open coffin in his room. Etna, one of the castle vassals, is standing next to him, surrounded by various weapons. She explains that he has been sleeping for two years, far longer than he intended, and his father, King Krichevskoy, has died. Laharl vows to reclaim the throne, and, after consulting with Etna and his other vassals, goes to Vyers\u0027 castle. \n \nAfter defeating the demon Vyers, who refers to himself as the \"Dark Adonis\" and is renamed \"Mid-Boss\" by Laharl, he meets Angel Trainee Flonne. Flonne had been sent to the Netherworld by Seraph Lamington, the ruler of Celestia, to assassinate King Krichevskoy (who was already dead). Shocked by Laharl\u0027s lack of grief at his father\u0027s death, the eternally optimistic Flonne joins Laharl\u0027s party to determine if demons are capable of feeling love. Observing them in secret is the paranoid Archangel Vulcanus, who interprets Flonne\u0027s actions as treason and is convinced that she is plotting against him. \n \nAfter Etna demands that Laharl pay the salary of the Prinnies that she has hired, he decides to attack the demon with the most money in the vicinity. This is Hoggmeiser at Dinero Palace. After defeating Hoggmeiser, Laharl is about to kill him, until Hoggmeiser\u0027s son rushes out and gets in the way. Flonne convinces Laharl to spare them, and Laharl lets them keep some of the money. In response to this act, Hoggmeiser joins the party. \n \nAt one point, Flonne and Etna discover a photograph of Laharl in an embarrassing situation. Laharl refers to this as a \"paparazzi shot\", however, the actual contents of the photo are never actually revealed. A threat on the back of the photograph states that copies of it would be distributed if Laharl did not accept a challenge to fight for the overlordship; thus Laharl was blackmailed. \n \nResponding to this challenge, Laharl meets Maderas, a vampire. He was banished by King Krichevskoy, for stealing the King\u0027s favorite snack, black pretzels. Maderas takes advantage of Laharl\u0027s two biggest weaknesses – optimism and women with sexy bodies. Maderas was also controlling Etna by holding her memory. He had instructed her to kill the prince, but she had put him to sleep for two years by poisoning him instead. Etna eventually betrays Maderas, and along with Laharl, Flonne, and Mid-Boss, defeats him. \n \nWaking up later at night, Flonne discovers that several Prinnies are chanting and leaving the castle. Laharl, worried that his reputation will be tarnished if it is discovered that he let his vassals escape, chases after them the next morning. Eventually, he runs into Death, and the player learns that Big Sis Prinny is actually Laharl\u0027s mother; she became a Prinny because she gave her life to save him.",
    "summary": "Players will initially take on the role of Overlord Laharl, a young demon prince who has just woken from a two-year long nap and finds out that his father, who was the king, has passed away. In order to regain his rightful title as King of the Netherworld, Laharl sets off on a demonic adventure, but must do so with a back stabbing servant, love stupid angel, and a few disgruntled penguins who are looking for trouble.",

In the shoes of Goku, the player must protect Bulma from incoming enemy attacks using special skills, such as fighting with his power pole, or unleashing a kamehameha. Combined with Bulma’s ability to invent machines and weapons, the intrepid pair make a formidable team able to defeat even the strongest enemies or trickiest of obstacles.\n\nThe innovative controls mean the player uses only the touch pad to control Goku. Players must draw lines or shapes to direct the character and control the action by tapping on the screen, for example a double tap on Goku followed by tapping on the Ka-me-ha-me-ha letters unleashes his devastating signature move.",

There is a main path in the story mode that coincides with Toriyama\u0027s story for every character and some other paths played out as \"what if?\" scenarios, adding replayability to the game. Next to the story mode, there is the Z battle, the VS battle, Maximum, Free battle and Practice mode. The game has three difficulty levels. In team battles the player can tap the touchscreen to select another fighter. Touch can also be used to perform a powerful combined attack when it is available.\n\nThe sequel moves away from the level system of the first game, where reaching a new character level led to upgraded statistics, or new sprites and attacks. This is replaced by individual characters that become available when a sufficient amount of Dragon Points is available.",

One of the games was developed by 5th Cell for the Nintendo DS, while the other was created by Planet Moon Studios for the Wii.[1][\n\nThe game begins with a surreal sequence, wherein an unknown party asks the player “What do you remember about that day?” The player is given several dialogue choices that build a cohesive description of \"that day\", though at this time, the player is not aware of the event\u0027s importance (or even occurrence). Before the game properly begins, the player is asked to draw an image depicting this mysterious scene, introducing them to the game\u0027s core \"draw\" functionality.\n\nFollowing this is an animation sequence wherein one of the characters from the previous game, Heather, recovers from a nightmare. She is shown to possess a red-colored jewel pendant. In the same sequence, Heather is abducted by a darkness which emanated from a scepter she discovered in a beached treasure chest in the middle of the night. The next morning, when the other characters realize she\u0027s missing, a search for her is dramatically cut short by Wilfre, who causes the majority of the Raposa villagers to vanish, reveals himself as Heather\u0027s captor, and ultimately drains the Village of color. The remaining characters flee to the back of a massive turtle delivered, upon request, by the Creator.\n\nTheir numbers sorely reduced and their home ruined, the game follows the Raposa\u0027s struggle to reunite with their fellows and, with the aid of the Creator\u0027s Hero of Creation, defeat Wilfre before he can realize his as-yet unknown goals. The remaining members of the Village travel to Watersong, Lavasteam, the Galactic Jungle, and Wilfre\u0027s Wasteland, a combination of all three villages. At Watersong, Mari and Jowee meet Sock, who is an important character later in the story.",

The characters have a \"super-deformed\" touch. There is also voice acting during cut-scenes. A new option has been added to the menu, which allows the player to read a conversation between party members and receive advice from them.\n\nIt also features many gameplay additions. The difficulty level has been increased, not only beyond the difficulty of the Western SNES release (which was reduced compared to Japanese original and subsequent ports), but even beyond the original difficulty. The party members are still bound by class, but they can now hunt for so-called \"augments\", which can be found or stolen from enemies and which grant the characters additional bonus abilities, resistances, spells that their class would normally not allow, etc.\n\nBeside those major changes, there are also plenty of minor additions. It is possible to obtain bonus items after exploring every corner and filling 100% of an area map; Rydia, the summoner girl, has a new monster summon who can be customized in various ways; there is a new quest involving the \"naming\" moogle of the original game, etc.",

A fossil park is hosting a large-scale tournament in which competitors enter vivosaurs created from dinosaur fossils into competition. Fossil Fighters from all over the world battle their vivosaurs against one another to find out who will be crowned champion.\n\nPlayers excavate and clean fossils. New giant fossil rocks (containing complete dinosaur fossils) and odd fossil rocks (which are two-sided) add to the fun of the cleaning process.\nOnce the fossils have been cleaned, they can be revived into Vivosaurs, which players can then arrange into teams for battles. The better the fossils have been cleaned, the more powerful the Vivosaurs are in battle.\nStrategy is key in battles. Players must put forth teams of three vivosaurs, then rotate their positions to maximize their power advantage over opponents.\nNew “super evolver” vivosaurs evolve into new forms with the help of gold fossils.\nPlayers can compete in matchmaking battles or upload their best team to see how it fares against others. Players can also download additional vivosaurs and events.\nUsing DS Download Play, one player who has the game can link up wirelessly with up to three other Nintendo DS owners within range and cooperate to expertly clean fossils together.",

It uses the Dark Alliance Engine.\n\nTwo handheld Justice League Heroes games were released at the same time for the GBA and Nintendo DS systems. The Nintendo DS game shares a similar visual style and gameplay mechanics to the console game, but serves as a prequel to its story. This version was developed by Sensory Sweep Studios.

The VCOs feature a sawtooth, a pulse (with a non-modifiable pulse width), a triangle and a noise waveform. There is also a four-part drum machine that uses the same sound creation techniques as the synthesizers. The sounds made by each of the synthesizer emulators are modified using virtual knobs to change the value of standard synthesizer parameters such as cutoff frequency and waveform shape. Additionally there is a screen where users can patch certain parameters to be modified by an LFO, the envelope generator, or VCO2.",

It is the sequel to Hotel Dusk: Room 215, starring protagonist Kyle Hyde and placed one year after the events of its predecessor. The game has visual and audio styles similar to that of the first game. In Last Window, Kyle Hyde is living in the Cape West Apartments, Los Angeles, in 1980. The story of this sequel is separate from the first game, even though it includes some connections to it. Last Window was the last game developed by Cing before the company filed for bankruptcy on March 1, 2010.",

With all these toys bringing him more money than he knows what to do with, Mario decides to fulfill his lifelong dream and open a theme park called Super Mini Mario World. The opening-day crowd includes Pauline and Donkey Kong, who immediately falls head over heels for the lovely lass. The proud ape tries to show off his Mini DK toy to Pauline, but she picks the Mini Mario toy over his and the jealous Donkey Kong becomes enraged. He smashes the displays, destroys the toys and takes Pauline to the top floor of the amusement park. Players must find Pauline and save the day. Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2 allows players to create their own maps with a new level editor. Once a map is created, players can send it across the world via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Players also can use Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to download maps created by others, check out a player-ranking system and access special bonuses. These unique features are sure to be a smash hit with puzzle fans everywhere.",

Humans and Reploids now coexist peacefully, both treated as humans due to the new laws.\n\nIn time, the habitants of Earth managed to revive some of the former nations. However, preventing further prosperity like the days of old, incidents around the world began where some of the machine life forms became Maverick, making some areas dangerous for the inhabitants, and soon this activity obstructed exchange between nations.\n\nThe nations became divided into areas designated as the Inner, where it was safe for humans to live, and the Outer region where the dangerous Mavericks appeared. Great developments were made due to the efforts of the corporation Slither Inc., which possesses technology unearthed from historic ruins in the outlands. Peaceful life is maintained by receiving the technology offered by Slither Inc. in the central areas of cities.\n\nIn the frontier regions where the crisis management of countries still doesn\u0027t reach, damage from attacks by Mavericks (general term for Reploids and Mechaniloids that threaten the peace) still occur. The humans in these areas developed the self-defense organization known as the Guardians. They defend the frontier regions and investigate the cause of the Maverick element.\n\nSlither Inc. uses the technology developed from historic ruin finds essentially as a lifeline for the cities, providing goods to its people such as energy resources. It is not necessarily a bad thing that the company has more or less grasped the lifeline of the cities, at least for the people in those cities. Slither Inc.\u0027s president is named Serpent. Serpent is considered a wonderful person who raised the company on his own by excavating the ancient technology sleeping in the Outlands. Furthermore, he has arranged a Mechaniloid army in his company, and is said to have repeatedly saved countries from Maverick attacks in the past.\n\nOn the other hand, the Guardians in the frontier regions are considered to be unassociated private ventures. They make the \"Guardian Base,\" a gigantic flying ship, their headquarters, and they take people on a volunteer basis to not only defend the frontier areas but also investigate the Maverick source. The original leader of the Guardians disappeared during the investigation of an Outlands area, and command has been taken over by the young girl named Prair",

    "storyline": "The game is the third title set in the series\u0027 Ubisoft continuity, and acts as a prequel to Heroes of Might and Magic V, taking place in the fictional world of Ashan prior to the events of the game (producers Erwan Le Breton and Romain de Waubert have noted it as 40 years before the cycle of Heroes V and Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, averaging at 946 YSD in the timeline).\n\nThe game\u0027s story mode centers on its five main protagonists: Godric, Aidan, Anwen, Nadia and Fiona, who command knights, demons, elves, wizards and necromancers respectively. Godric and Anwen previously appeared as playable characters in Heroes V, while further returning characters shown in screenshots include Cyrus, Findan and Markal. The protagonists have been described as five lost children whose lives are shattered by \"a mysterious Demon Lord with very sinister motives\". This demon lord turns out to be Azh Rafir, Nadia\u0027s father, who had devised a mad scheme to use a powerful artifact known as the Blade of Binding to open the gates to the demon world of Sheogh and drown Ashan in chaos. He is shown to worship Urgash, the dragon of chaos, in Fiona\u0027s story. It is also shown, in Aidan\u0027s story, that Aidan had unknowingly taken the Blade of Binding. After the revelation that her own father had broken her life and those of her friends, a heartbroken Nadia decides to fight Azh Rafir in his demon lord form in the story\u0027s climax. After vanquishing him, she destroys the Blade of Binding and finally derails his scheme, bringing peace to Ashan.",

Whenever someone is stressed out or backed into a corner, all they need to do is shout \"Ouendan!\" (Japanese for \"Cheer Squad\"). Then, the Ouendan appear (usually out of a place like a closet or waiting there while eating ramen) and use cheering and dance to help that someone through their troubles. The map of the territory that the Ouendan patrol within Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii is the same as that found in the original game, although it has been turned ninety degrees and is now rendered using 3D graphics. \n \nThe original Ouendan (signified by wearing their long Gakuran jackets) are still present in this game, cheering people on. However, a new rival Ouendan appear that challenge the original Ouendan in skill and cheering (the \"new\" Ouendan are signified by their blue military-style outfits.) The individual stories are all unrelated, but characters featured in one stage may appear as background or supporting characters in another. One can also see characters from the first Ouendan game as lead, supporting or background characters, such as the pottery maker from the first game that appears as a guest at a hot springs, and gifts the hot springs family with new pottery work should the player be successful in the stage. In the final stage, all of the characters in the game unite when the two Ouendan join together and once again lead the entire world in a cheer to save Earth when the sun\u0027s activity stops, plunging Earth into another ice age.",

The original Ouendan and joined by a new team, the Morning City Ouendan, who wear blue in contrast to the black of the Evening City Ouendan. \n \nGameplay is largely identical to the original, tapping, sliding and spinning to match the beat of the song playing, in order to progress through different stages of a song. The closer the player gets to matching the song, the more points will be earned and the better the rank achieved. The whole game is played using the stylus. \n \nImprovements made in 2006\u0027s Elite Beat Agents (the non Japanese \"remake\" of Ouendan) have been carried over, such as the ability to completely skip introductions and unlockable songs. One replay can be saved on each song, improving the system from Elite Beat Agents.",

What follows could be the next giant leap forward for mankind, but just what are we stepping into?

The touch screen allows the player to pet a dog, as well as to use various items that can be found or purchased. These range from balls and frisbees, to toys, to grooming supplies to keep the dogs happy. The microphone is used to call to the player\u0027s dog by speaking the name given to the dog in the beginning of the game as well as to teach the dog tricks such as \"sit\" or \"roll over\".

In each stage, players use the DS touchscreen to tap specifically marked spots that appear in rhythm to various Japanese pop songs, scoring points for accurate timing and avoiding a poor performance which can cause the stage to end prematurely.

    "storyline": "The first case of the game presents defense attorney Phoenix Wright at his first trial under Mia Fey\u0027s watchful eye, successfully defending his childhood friend Larry Butz for murder. However, in the game\u0027s second case, Mia is murdered for being aware of corporate blackmail, and her younger sister Maya Fey is charged with the crime because her name was found on a piece of evidence. While defending her, Phoenix is reintroduced to another childhood friend, Miles Edgeworth, who is the prosecutor for Maya\u0027s case and has established himself as a \"genius\" for the prosecution system. Maya is found not guilty of the crime, and becomes Phoenix\u0027s assistant in further cases, offering her channeling ability as a \"Spirit Medium\" of Kurain village to bring the spirit of Mia to help at critical times. Phoenix and Edgeworth find that while they have their friendship from their youth, they continue to face off against each other in the courtroom. In the third case, Phoenix and Maya investigate the murder of a famous actor.In the fourth case, Edgeworth is charged with murder, and Phoenix steps up to defend him. It is discovered that Edgeworth was set up by his old mentor, Manfred von Karma. Several years earlier, Manfred shot and killed Edgeworth\u0027s father, a defense attorney, after he ruined Manfred\u0027s perfect record, but led Edgeworth to believe he shot his own father. Phoenix is able to expose Manfred\u0027s cover-up and achieve a \"not guilty\" verdict for Edgeworth. After the case, Edgeworth thinks about taking time off from his position to consider the events, while Maya announces she is going back to her home in Kurain Village to train.\nThe fifth case, added for the Nintendo DS, iOS, and Wii versions, has Ema Skye begging Wright for help to defend her older sister Lana, who is on trial for murder, compounded by a second murder of the same apparent victim in a different building at the same time. Using Ema\u0027s scientific help to establish evidence and the surprising prosecution help of Edgeworth during the trial, Phoenix is able to learn that Lana Skye was blackmailed by the Chief of Police Damon Gant into covering for a murder she thought that Ema had committed several years before. Gant himself is revealed to have committed the murder and pinned the blame on Ema. Though Lana is cleared of murder charges, she willingly goes to jail for being an accomplice; Ema says her goodbyes as she heads to Europe to study forensic science.",

    "summary": "Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney − Trials and Tribulations (known as Gyakuten Saiaban 3 in Japan) is the third game in the Ace Attorney series. Players take on the role of Phoenix Wright, a defense attorney known for taking on seemingly impossible cases. While the game focuses on a few specific cases, the overarching story of the Phoenix Wright franchise spans the length of the series, involving obscure characters from large families and intricate webs of lies, plots, and murder. The nature of the series remains generally lighthearted, something that\u0027s reinforced by its playful, anime-inspired visual style, but the nature of the crimes committed can be cold and downright disturbing. While the game\u0027s legal acumen is highly dubious, its aim seems to be more about producing comedic or stereotypically dramatic courtroom moments. Ace Attorney 3 makes light use of the DS touch screen, allowing the player to examine crime scenes and inspect evidence and character profiles. The top screen is used more for storytelling purposes, displaying various dialogue and conversations between characters. During these sequences the lower screen becomes a selection menu, displaying a series of questions to ask witnesses and further your investigation in search of evidence to use in defense of your client in each chapter.",

    "storyline": "The games chronicle the adventures of a new Pokémon trainer who strives to become the Pokémon League Champion by collecting and training Pokémon. Like most games in the series, Diamond and Pearl feature eight Pokémon gyms led by Gym Leaders, professional trainers whose expertise lies in a particular Pokémon type. Gym Leaders (Roark, Gardenia, Maylene, Wake, Fantina, Byron, Candace, and Volkner) serve as bosses and reward skilled trainers with Gym badges, key to the advancement of the plot. As in Ruby and Sapphire, the protagonist must also thwart the schemes of a crime syndicate (and here, it is Team Galactic), who plans to use Pokémon to restructure the region into a utopia.\n\nLike all other Pokémon RPGs, Diamond and Pearl begin in the protagonist\u0027s hometown. After viewing a television report about a media-conducted search for a Red Gyarados, which was spotted at a faraway lake (Johto\u0027s Lake of Rage) the protagonist and his or her best friend travel together to check the local lake for a Pokémon like it. They spot Professor Rowan, a Pokémon evolution researcher, and his assistant, the playable character not selected in the game: Lucas (boy) or Dawn (girl). After a short discussion, the professor and his assistant leave the lake, leaving a briefcase behind. When they are attacked by wild Starly, the protagonist and his or her rival examine the case. The player is then given a choice among the three Pokémon found in the briefcase (Turtwig, Chimchar, or Piplup) with which to battle the Starly. After defeating the Starly, Lucas or Dawn retrieves and returns the briefcase to the professor. Noticing that a bond has been forged between the young protagonist and his or her chosen Pokémon, Rowan offers it to him or her, asking that he or she embark on a journey and fill his or her Pokédex.\n\nThe protagonist encounters the main antagonist, Team Galactic, early in the game, when he or she must save Professor Rowan from its thugs; however, its motives are unclear until later. The protagonist encounters the Team twice (when it takes over a wind farm and when it sets up a base in Eterna City) before it takes over Sinnoh\u0027s three lakes in an attempt to capture the Mirage Pokémon (Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit). Shortly after the player earns his or her seventh Gym Badge, Team Galactic captures the Mirage Pokémon and imprisons them inside the science laboratory of the Team Galactic Headquarters Building, where its members extract crystals from the Pokémon to create the Red Chain, an object that can control the legendary Pokémon Palkia (in Pearl) or Dialga (in Diamond) (both in Pokémon Platinum, though Giratina appears after this). After releasing the trio, the protagonist is able to access the cave atop Mt. Coronet, where the leader of Team Galactic awakens Dialga or Palkia. The legendary Pokémon\u0027s powers begin to overwhelm Sinnoh, causing the newly free Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit to attempt to stop it. The player then battles Palkia/Dialga; after defeating or capturing the Pokémon, Sinnoh returns to normal. After this, the player will continue, eventually battling the Sinnoh Region Pokémon League\u0027s Elite Four: Aaron, Bertha, Flint, and Lucian. After defeating all four members, the player will battle the Sinnoh League champion, a woman named Cynthia, who had appeared before in the game. If the protagonist beats Cynthia, he or she is the new Sinnoh League champion, beating the game. After the player beats the game, there is a new island to explore that is filled with other types of Pokémon. His or her old friend, who challenged him or her to battles multiple times before, will be waiting for him or her here. The old friend will challenge the player to another battle. On this island, there are also stores and a tournament center.",

The games add many new features, such as Internet play over the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and changes to battle mechanics and Pokémon Contests, along with addition of 107 new Pokémon. The games are independent of each other but feature largely the same plot and while both can be played separately, it is necessary to trade between them in order to complete the games\u0027 Pokédexes.",

While the games feature several expansions in key areas, the overall plot follows the same direction as the original Gold and Silver. Some aspects exclusive to Crystal are also included. Like how FireRed and LeafGreen could link up with Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald to complete the Pokédex by trading regionally exclusive Pokémon, HeartGold and SoulSilver can link up with Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum to obtain Pokémon unavailable in Johto and Kanto (such as the Sinnoh starters) and vice versa.\nKris, despite being the female counterpart of Crystal\u0027s player character, is not included as the female player character, with a new character instead taking her place. Whether she is chosen to be the player character or not, this new character will still appear in the game. The unselected protagonist will take a pseudo-rival role similar to the unselected characters of Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum.\nThe games were released on September 12, 2009 in Japan, February 4, 2010 in Korea, March 14, 2010 in North America, March 25, 2010 in Australia and March 26, 2010 in Europe (this excludes the Netherlands, Luxembourg and parts of Belgium due to an in-game save error, with the patched copies later released on April 2, 2010).",

    "storyline": "The games chronicle the adventures of a new Pokémon trainer who strives to become the Pokémon League Champion by collecting and training Pokémon. Like most games in the series, Diamond and Pearl feature eight Pokémon gyms led by Gym Leaders, professional trainers whose expertise lies in a particular Pokémon type. Gym Leaders (Roark, Gardenia, Maylene, Wake, Fantina, Byron, Candace, and Volkner) serve as bosses and reward skilled trainers with Gym badges, key to the advancement of the plot. As in Ruby and Sapphire, the protagonist must also thwart the schemes of a crime syndicate (and here, it is Team Galactic), who plans to use Pokémon to restructure the region into a utopia.\n\nLike all other Pokémon RPGs, Diamond and Pearl begin in the protagonist\u0027s hometown. After viewing a television report about a media-conducted search for a Red Gyarados, which was spotted at a faraway lake (Johto\u0027s Lake of Rage) the protagonist and his or her best friend travel together to check the local lake for a Pokémon like it. They spot Professor Rowan, a Pokémon evolution researcher, and his assistant, the playable character not selected in the game: Lucas (boy) or Dawn (girl). After a short discussion, the professor and his assistant leave the lake, leaving a briefcase behind. When they are attacked by wild Starly, the protagonist and his or her rival examine the case. The player is then given a choice among the three Pokémon found in the briefcase (Turtwig, Chimchar, or Piplup) with which to battle the Starly. After defeating the Starly, Lucas or Dawn retrieves and returns the briefcase to the professor. Noticing that a bond has been forged between the young protagonist and his or her chosen Pokémon, Rowan offers it to him or her, asking that he or she embark on a journey and fill his or her Pokédex.\n\nThe protagonist encounters the main antagonist, Team Galactic, early in the game, when he or she must save Professor Rowan from its thugs; however, its motives are unclear until later. The protagonist encounters the Team twice (when it takes over a wind farm and when it sets up a base in Eterna City) before it takes over Sinnoh\u0027s three lakes in an attempt to capture the Mirage Pokémon (Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit). Shortly after the player earns his or her seventh Gym Badge, Team Galactic captures the Mirage Pokémon and imprisons them inside the science laboratory of the Team Galactic Headquarters Building, where its members extract crystals from the Pokémon to create the Red Chain, an object that can control the legendary Pokémon Palkia (in Pearl) or Dialga (in Diamond) (both in Pokémon Platinum, though Giratina appears after this). After releasing the trio, the protagonist is able to access the cave atop Mt. Coronet, where the leader of Team Galactic awakens Dialga or Palkia. The legendary Pokémon\u0027s powers begin to overwhelm Sinnoh, causing the newly free Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit to attempt to stop it. The player then battles Palkia/Dialga; after defeating or capturing the Pokémon, Sinnoh returns to normal. After this, the player will continue, eventually battling the Sinnoh Region Pokémon League\u0027s Elite Four: Aaron, Bertha, Flint, and Lucian. After defeating all four members, the player will battle the Sinnoh League champion, a woman named Cynthia, who had appeared before in the game. If the protagonist beats Cynthia, he or she is the new Sinnoh League champion, beating the game. After the player beats the game, there is a new island to explore that is filled with other types of Pokémon. His or her old friend, who challenged him or her to battles multiple times before, will be waiting for him or her here. The old friend will challenge the player to another battle. On this island, there are also stores and a tournament center.",
    "summary": "Pokémon Pearl Version and Diamond Version are role-playing games (RPGs) developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS. With the enhanced remake Pokémon Platinum, the games comprise the fifth installment and fourth generation of the Pokémon series of RPGs. First released in Japan on September 28, 2006, the games were later released to North America, Australia, and Europe over the course of 2007.\nLike previous Pokémon games, Diamond and Pearl chronicle the adventures of a young Pokémon trainer as he/she trains and battles Pokémon while also thwarting the schemes of a criminal organization. The games add many new features, such as Internet play over the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and changes to battle mechanics and Pokémon Contests, along with addition of 107 new Pokémon. The games are independent of each other but feature largely the same plot and while both can be played separately, it is necessary to trade between them in order to complete the games\u0027 Pokédexes.",

Inside, the old couple show the two another time machine in the guise of a giant clock, and they find themselves in a drastically-changed quasi-steam punk London ten years from their present, where they meet the Future Luke. He explains that in this future, Layton has become the head of a mafia-like mob known as the Family and taken control of London, and decides to assist him. After briefly returning to the past to look up some files pertaining to an accident which claimed the life of his girlfriend, Claire, ten years ago, Layton and Luke return to the future London, inadvertently bringing Flora, Inspector Chelmey and his assistant Barton with him. As the group investigates the whereabouts of Future Layton, Luke is reminded that he will soon be moving with his parents.",
    "summary": "As with previous Professor Layton games, Unwound Future is an adventure game where the player solves puzzles offered by local citizens to progress the story forward, through dialogue and around 32 minutes of full motion video. The player moves about the game through still images of locations. The player can use the DS touchscreen to tap on non-player characters to start a dialog or to obtain a puzzle, and also can search anywhere on the background for hint coins, with some areas needing to be tapped several times to reveal a secret hint coin or puzzle. Puzzles are brainteasers of many varieties, including visual, math, and logic. There is no time limit to solve puzzles, and the player can get up to 3 hints at a cost of one hint coin each; a new feature in Unwound Future is a \"super hint\", costing 2 coins, that can only be bought after the other 3 hints have been revealed, but that nearly reveals the puzzle\u0027s solution. If the player is correct in solving the puzzle, they gain a number of \"Picarats\", a form of currency within the game. Guessing the incorrect answer will reduce the number of picarats the player can get on subsequent attempts. Players can visit certain areas in order to play undiscovered or unsolved puzzles that are left behind as the story progresses.",

It turns out that the \"comets\" are actually six familiar characters from the Madou series, who serve as boss characters in the story modes.",

    "storyline": "*Warning: Spoilers* \n \nOn the continent of Vainqueur, a land of man and beasts, the holy nation of the East, Alistel is in a state of war with Granorg, a massive country to the West that is ruled harshly by Queen Protea. Alistel\u0027s land is slowly turning to desert while a strange disease, known as the \"Sand Plague\", is turning its people into sand. The ruler of Alistel, the Prophet Noah, insists this worldwide disease is the result of Protea\u0027s evil government. The people of Alistel thus believe they are fighting a holy war against Granorg. \n \nOne day, Stocke and his subordinates, agents with the intelligence agency of Alistel, are sent into Granorg territory to rescue a secret agent who was captured by the government of Granorg. After saving the agent, the group find themselves surrounded by the Granorg army, and Stocke is severely wounded. He awakens in Historia, a world where time and space are warped. There, two mysterious children, Teo and Lippti, give him the ability to travel through time and space using the power of a book his employer Heiss gave him, the White Chronicle. After using this new power to travel through time to avoid defeat, Stocke is given a choice: continue working under Heiss in the intelligence division, or join his friend Rosch\u0027s unit within the military. Each choice creates a timeline and each timeline has its own separate story, which nonetheless relates to the other one. Stocke is often forced to move between timelines to acquire skills and information he would not otherwise have access to, in order to avoid disasters, ambushes or simply to position himself properly to take advantage of his enemies or friends. \n \nUnder Heiss, Stocke is sent to Granorg to assassinate Princess Eruca. He only manages to enter the city by pretending to be part of a group of traveling entertainers, most of whom are Satyros, one of the native beastmen races of the continent. Among them are Aht, a nine-year-old shaman who, for better or worse, begins idolizing Stocke and using her abilities to protect him. Once he arrives in Granorg, he discovers that the princess knew he would be coming, and moreover, had not informed anyone else. Stocke learns that Eruca is the de facto leader of the resistance against her stepmother\u0027s reign, and is therefore more an asset to Alistel\u0027s war on Granorg than an enemy. Eruca also reveals that she is the only living descendant of the empire\u0027s rulers, and thus the only person who can perform the ritual to prevent desertification. However, as Queen Protea refuses to allow her to perform the ritual, the world could turn to sand in less than a decade unless Protea is removed from power. \n \nStocke refrains from carrying out the assassination, thus securing her support. Oddly enough, he is also aided in this regard by his appearance, which is similar to Eruca\u0027s late older brother, Ernst, who was executed by her father for treason. Despite his best intentions, his failure to complete his mission brands him a traitor in Alistel, and General Hugo orders his execution. \n \nIn the other timeline, Stocke is assigned to Rosch\u0027s unit and deployed to protect Alistel\u0027s mines from enemy sabotage, as well as protect a cavern which is the only route connecting the two mountainous territories of Granorg and Alistel, other than a slim valley protected by the oft-traded Sand Fortress. After successfully defending the mines, Stocke and Rosch are rewarded by General Hugo with promotions, but he also assigns them to the Sand Fortress with a platoon of new recruits. Alistel\u0027s second-in-command, Lt. General Raul, assumes this is to remove any possible future political opponents from the city, as Field Marshal Viola, who also was gaining popularity against Hugo\u0027s will, was also assigned there. After defeating the Granorg army in two battles, Rosch\u0027s entire brigade is killed. Stocke then discovers a piece of paper proving that the Granorgites were being leaked information from within Alistel. \n \nStocke returns with the critically wounded Rosch to Alistel, and, taking the advice of Lt. General Raul, sneaks into Hugo\u0027s office to search for evidence of deals with Granorg. He finds a coded note that he believes to show the truth, and promptly flees Alistel with Raul, Rosch, and Rosch\u0027s doctor, Sonja. They arrive in Celestia and learn that Hugo had a secret pact with Protea\u0027s advisors, Dias and Selvan, to eliminate Protea from the throne, annex Granorg, and then conquer the entire continent. Stocke convinces Rosch to become the commander of Celestia\u0027s army, and Celestia prepares for war against Granorg and Alistel. \n \nIn the history created by Stocke refusing to leave Heiss, Stocke finds asylum in the desert nation of Cygnus, and convinces King Garland the Mighty to prepare for war against Granorg. Eruca then takes him to meet the Gutral tribe, who only meet with humans if they bear the sacred \"Beast Mark\". Stocke acquires the Mark, and recruits the Gutrals to fight against Granorg. They depose Protea, in doing so obtaining the \"Etherion\", a Granorg treasure that can neutralize a weapon designed under the orders of Hugo that turns its victims to sand. \n \nStocke returns to the other timeline, recruits the Gutrals using his Beast Mark, and enters the annexed Granorg with the Etherion. After defeating the Dias Knights and reluctantly killing Viola, who chose to remain loyal to Alistel because she believed that the death of her, the Valkyrie, would convince its troops to give up their fight, Stocke discovers that Hugo has been forced into confession by Alistel citizens that Noah was dead the whole time. Stocke pursues Hugo to Alistel and slays him. \n \nIn the final chapter of the \"True History\", created by both timelines combining, Heiss invades Granorg\u0027s Royal Hall, where the ritual to stop desertification is performed. Stocke confronts him, and Heiss explains that the sacrificial victims of the ritual are royals who were killed by their own family, and brought back to life by giving them part of their sibling\u0027s soul. During the ritual, the Sacrifice dies again, and the half of a soul returns to its original body, stabilizing the Mana of the continent, and thus slowing desertification, in the process. Stocke is, Heiss explains, Eruca\u0027s late brother Ernst, who was executed by his father King Victor for treason, given a part of a soul by Eruca for use in the ritual, and then captured by Heiss, who was Victor\u0027s brother and an intended Sacrifice himself, and had his memories modified so he\u0027d live the life of Stocke. \n \nHeiss believes that the suffering of the royal family, which he has seen as a Sacrifice, and thus a wielder of the Black Chronicle, is caused by their attempts to protect a world that is not worth saving. He plans to recruit Stocke to his side, leaving Eruca as the only living member of the royal family without any Sacrifices to use, but Stocke refuses. Heiss then attempts to absorb enough souls to hasten desertification enough to destroy the world altogether, so Sacrifices will no longer be necessary. He fails, and uses the Black Chronicle to take the party to Historia, which, along with the Chronicles, was created with the intention of enlightening Sacrifices, resulting in the ritual being more effective. He then consumes the suffering of all past Sacrifices, and becomes the monster Apocrypha, which is destroyed by Stocke and his allies. \n \nIf the player has not done sufficient sidequests, the game ends with Stocke being sacrificed by Eruca to prevent the desertification. However, it is possible to unlock a better ending, in which the player can see the major characters continuing to live out their lives; most notably, Raynie promises to wait for Stocke to return, Viola survives her wounds and is cured of an illness she became afflicted with on the front lines, and Rosch and Sonja are married, and encounter the soldiers in Rosch\u0027s brigade, whom they thought all dead. One of the soldiers explains a man who is implied to be Stocke rescued them. Heiss and Stocke wait in Historia during this ideal ending, and Heiss forcibly sacrifices himself instead of Stocke, seeing the difference Stocke made to the lives of the characters affected by the aforementioned sidequests, and realizing the world is worth saving. Stocke then returns to the real world. \n \n-Source: Wikipedia",
    "summary": "In the midst of an unending war for dominance between two super-powers, Special Intelligence Agent Stocke is assigned to a routine escort mission that goes horribly awry. However, wielding a mysterious book called the White Chronicle, Stocke discovers a way to travel to the intersection of time itself: Historia. With this power in his hands, he must travel back and forth through key events and an entirely alternate timeline to right the world\u0027s ill-fated course. The lives of his companions, the fate of nations, and the resolution of an impending disaster that now threatens the land all depend on Stocke\u0027s ability to discern the one \"true\" history.",

    "storyline": "The story begins as an incomplete continuation of the previous chapter. It starts out with Gina attending Brian\u0027s funeral, and it is noted that she is the only mourner in sight. \n \nIntroduction \nThe introduction shows the eye of a crow, fading out to show Brian\u0027s funeral, where there are only four people: a priest, who is speaking in Latin; Luane, who is the cemetery\u0027s manager; Ernie, who is the Happy Dale Mental Hospital security guard; and Gina, Brian\u0027s girlfriend. This scene is spliced with flashbacks to a trial, where Brian is accused of apparently killing General Kordsmier, but due to a case of amnesia, he is deemed insane and locked away in a mental institution. \n \nChapter 1: Brian Basco is Dead \nAfter the funeral has ended, Gina receives a call from Brian, who tells her to save him, because he\u0027s trapped in his own grave. He ends the call because his battery is very low. Just before the battery dies, he sends a message to Gina. \n \nChapter 2: The Art of Running Away \nGabbo, a friend of Brian\u0027s from the asylum, tells Gina the story about how Brian escapes. Gabbo tells Brian a plan, but Kurgan steals the plan and runs off to use it himself. With a bit of improvisation, Brian overcomes these obstacles but stops part-way through the escape as he finds Kurgan decapitated. \n \nChapter 3: A Timely Suicide \nIn a cabin out in the woods, Gina helps a psychologist investigate the death of a witness that would have exonerated Brian. His death had been ruled a suicide. \n \nChapter 4: An Unexpected Ally \nThe story of Brian\u0027s escape resumes, as we learn how he plans on using Kurgan\u0027s body to look like his own. \n \nChapter 5: Deconstructing Brian \nWe finally learn some of what happened between the ending of Runaway 2 and the opening of this game. Also, Gina gets tied up as Tarantula catches up with her. \n \nChapter 6: The End is Here \nBrian comes up with a plan to defeat Tarantula and her goons, exonerate himself and rescue Gina. The series is brought to a fitting ending.",

There are others with COMPs, so-called demon tamers, who seek to use the demons to satisfy their own whims-be they for justice, peace, or power-in the chaos that was once downtown Tokyo. Where did the demons come from? Why did they appear? Who created the COMPs, and what is their purpose? These questions must soon be answered, for if you fail to solve the mystery, much more is at stake than your own lives.",

The park is made up of several planet-sized attractions. Suspicious, Sonic the Hedgehog and his best friend Tails investigate. They meet Yacker, who comes from a species of aliens known as Wisps. After Tails invents a translator to communicate with him, they learn that other Wisps have been enslaved by Eggman, who plans to harness their energy for a mind-control laser that will allow him to take over Earth.\n\nSonic proceeds to visit the planets, liberating the Wisps and shutting down the generators linked to the amusement park. He meets many of his friends along the way, who are also exploring the park in an attempt to disrupt Eggman\u0027s plans. After Sonic frees the Wisps, Eggman tries to fire the cannon at the world, but a piece of wreckage causes it to malfunction. As the amusement park begins to explode, Sonic confronts Eggman. Eggman uses the Nega-Wisps to power his final contraption, a robot that uses the powers of all the Wisps that Sonic has met against him. As the machine gets weaker, the Wisps escape and help Sonic defeat Eggman, sending him hurtling off into space. The Wisps carry Sonic out of the exploding amusement park. Returning safely to Earth, Yacker thanks Sonic and Tails.\n\nHowever, Sonic and Tails soon learn that the leading Mother Wisp had been infected by the negative energy and transformed into the Nega-Mother Wisp. Using the power of the Chaos Emeralds, Sonic transforms into Super Sonic and fights her. Following her defeat, the Mother Wisp returns to normal and the Wisps part ways with the two heroes. In a post-credits scene, Eggman is seen stranded in space with his henchmen Orbot and Cubot.",

However, they were stolen by Dr. Eggman and as Blaze was chasing him, a light brought her to this world. Blaze then makes it her goal to personally retrieve the Emeralds from Eggman. Upon finding Eggman, the doctor flaunts a Sol Emerald, stating that he needs them to access ultimate power. Enraged, Blaze defeats Eggman and regains the Emerald. Though Eggman escapes, Blaze is determined to get the rest.\n\nConfused and alone, Blaze ponders how she will get the Sol Emeralds back, and how to return home. She soon spots Cream the Rabbit and Cheese hiding in the bushes, and is surprised by Cream\u0027s politeness, the young rabbit eager to make friends with Blaze. Brought to Cream\u0027s home for a cup of tea, Vanilla and Cream convince Blaze to have the latter be her local guide after hearing her story. However, Blaze dismisses their advice to seek Sonic\u0027s aid, believing she can do this alone. Despite having Cream tag along, Blaze remains mostly indifferent to the young rabbit\u0027s efforts to be her friend.\n\nElsewhere, Sonic encounters Eggman during a run, who boasts about how he will soon have ultimate power. Upon defeating Eggman, Sonic finds a Sol Emerald that Eggman dropped, at which point Blaze appears and reclaims it, thanking Sonic for defeating Eggman before leaving. Confused, Sonic teams up with Tails to figure out what is going on while collecting the Chaos Emeralds.",

    "storyline": "In the game, the player controls the actions of American lawyer Kate Walker, who is sent to a remote French village in order to finalize the take-over of a toy factory. Once at the village, Kate learns that the woman who owned the factory has just died, and she has a brother who must be contacted in order for the takeover to proceed. Her mission takes her across Central and Eastern Europe, which gradually leads her to question her own life. The titular Syberia is a mythical island on which mammoths are said to live.\n\nThe game starts with Kate arriving in the fictional French village of Valadilène and witnessing the funeral of Anna Voralberg, the owner of a family-owned spring-automaton toy factory. When Kate visits the village notary to finalize the deal, the notary tells her that just before Anna\u0027s death, the old lady revealed that her brother is not dead and buried, but alive somewhere in the North-East. Now that his sister is dead, Hans Voralberg becomes the new owner of the factory, which cannot be sold without his approval. Kate has no choice: If she wants the takeover to succeed, she will have to find Hans. Kate\u0027s research reveals that Hans was injured in his attempt to retrieve a prehistoric doll of a man riding a mammoth. It stunted his development, leaving him mentally handicapped, and Hans\u0027 sole goal became to find mammoths to ride as the doll depicts.\n\nIn order to find Hans, Kate must take his train: a clockwork locomotive built by his sister at his request. It is manned by Oscar, an animatronic man fond of protocol whom Kate must satisfy to depart. She is forced to dive into Hans\u0027 past to retrieve two items of value to him: the mammoth doll and a clockwork music box.\n\nAs she follows Hans\u0027 path, Kate makes her way to Barrockstadt, a failing university whose train station acts as a botanical garden. The train stops short of the winding mechanism so Kate must barter with a nearby couple with a barge. They insist on being paid $100 for their assistance, so Kate has to fix the university\u0027s broken bandstand to get the university\u0027s stubborn board of directors to help. Along the way, she gets a lesson on the legend of Syberia and the customs of the mysterious prehistoric Youkol people who lived with mammoths and were able to domesticate them. Before she can leave Barrockstadt entirely, she must pass the large wall that keeps her train from exiting.\n\nThe next stop is Komkolzgrad, a dusty Communist-era industrial mining complex with two giant metallic worker-automata overlooking the tracks. The place is run by the eccentric and somewhat crazy Serguei Borodine, who steals Oscar\u0027s hands to make his automaton organist work. He intends to construct the biggest stage possible for Helena Romanski, a washed-up opera singer with whom he is obsessed. Kate has little choice but to fetch her from a nearby spa in Aralbad on his behalf. Serguei directs Kate to the adjacent cosmodrome for transportation.\n\nAt the cosmodrome, Kate meets former test pilot Boris, a drunk who dreams of flying into space on a \"flying wing\" invented by Hans. After some sobering up, he teaches Kate how to operate an old airship in exchange for her help in making the flying wing functional. He also warns Kate not to trust Serguei. Once Boris is launched, she uses his advice to launch the airship and leaves for Aralbad.\n\nAt the Aralbad spa, Kate meets Helena after getting past the manager. The elderly lady believes she is too old to sing, having lost her legendary voice, which could break glass. With a special cocktail mixed at the bar and a wine glass, Kate convinces Helena that she can still sing. Helena agrees to go with Kate.\n\nThe performance in Komkolzgrad does not go quite as planned: beautiful though Helena\u0027s voice may be (she sings \"Dark Eyes\"), it doesn\u0027t stop Serguei from imprisoning her, as he wants to keep Helena at his side as his personal opera singer. Kate is able to free Helena and take back Oscar\u0027s hands, but Serguei isn\u0027t quite willing to give up without a fight, using the worker-automata to block the train. Some spare dynamite dispatches that problem, and Kate brings Helena back to Aralbad. Surprisingly, none other than Hans Voralberg is waiting there at the spa, delighted that Kate brought him his train and Oscar. Hans shows little concern for his sister\u0027s death and signs the factory release papers without even reading them. He offers to take Kate along, but she initially refuses. However, as she is about to board a plane to fly back to New York, she changes her mind and hops on board the train at the last second, abandoning her job and her unfaithful fiancé back home to help an old man realize his dream.",

    "summary": "Taiko no Tatsujin DS: TOUCH de Dokodon is a rhythm game for Nintendo DS by Namco Bandai where you play a Taiko drum to the beat of several songs. There are optional button controls, but the main mode of control is to take two styli and tap on the touch screen, which shows the image of large Taiko drum.\n\nThe two main gamemodes are Free Play and Daily Dojo. Free Play is exactly as one would expect, and Daily Dojo is a once-a-day challenge on a random song you\u0027ve unlocked. There are four difficulties: Flower, Bamboo, Tree, and Demon. Demon difficulty, also known as Oni Mode, is initially hidden and must be unlocked. In addition to the actual gameplay, you can also dress up your Taiko character in silly outfits. This does not affect actual gameplay and is only a visual change. There is also a multiplayer mode available. It can be played in single-cart mode, but if an opponent has a copy of the game the outfit they have dressed their Taiko in will appear on whatever character corresponds to which player they are.\n\nThe game comes with two \"Bachi Pens\", which are Taiko no Tatsujin-themed styli for use with the game, and is rated A on the CERO rating system (the Japanese equivalent of an E for Everyone on the ESRB rating system).",

Mix it up with some mini-games! Hook up with your friends over local wireless (existing connection is required) and face off in fabulous mini-games, Race to the ocean floor in Depth Chargers, hook the big one in Fishing Derby, rush to trace shapes in Sand Tracer, and shoot some change in Coin Slinger, or challenge yourself to see how many tasty octopus snacks you can cook up in Dumpling Master!

Spryo\u0027s primary attack is his headbutt, but he can also use his assorted breaths to defeat foes provided that he has enough magic power. He also earns blue gems from defeating foes which will allow him to level up his powers.",

    "summary": "Nanashi no Game: Me (??? ? ??? ? Nanashi no Geemu Me?, lit. \"Nameless Game: Eye\") is a survival horror video game for the Nintendo DS, and the sequel to the original Nanashi no Game. It was developed by Epics, published by Square Enix, and released on August 27, 2009 in Japan. The story follows an anthropology student from Nanto University, as he discovers two cursed games, an RPG and a platformer. The game\u0027s title refers to the protagonist\u0027s left eye, represented by the left screen of the DS when held sideways, which allows the player to see things left (and hidden) by the curse. It sold 15,000 copies on the week of its release. \n \nMuch like in the original, Nanashi no Game: Me involves two separate modes of play. Most of the game takes place in the real world, where the player navigates real-time 3D environments using the DS\u0027s D-Pad and Touch Screen. While exploring, the player must solve puzzles and reach locations. The player can switch to the TS Menu at any time, where they can play the cursed game, read e-mail messages, and load a previous save file. In many cases, an e-mail message or update to the cursed game will interrupt the player\u0027s exploration. In the cursed game, which only uses the top DS screen, the player controls a 2D 8-bit RPG that provides clues to the current situations and can, in some cases, advance the story. In Nanashi no Game: Me, the player can now choose the locations they want to explore out of the two available for each day (for three days only). Each destination provides different experiences, including the Regrets the player will encounter.",

    "storyline": "The game starts at the neighborhood level. Here you can create a housing development from scratch or start with one of three pre-made neighborhoods, each with its own theme. From there, you\u0027ll settle on a house and a family of Sims to control. Sims now have aspirations, wants, and fears. The wants and fears are the day-to-day things that occupy their minds, like wanting to see friends or get married and fearing death or being rejected for a kiss. Satisfy their wants, and they become more efficient at completing tasks you assign them. Realize their fears, and Sims become lethargic, cranky, and unresponsive to your commands. Aspirations are the big-picture things, like raising a family, becoming wealthy, and gaining knowledge. Succeed here and you\u0027ll be able to buy odd gifts for your Sim to improve his or her life, like a money tree that pays dividends or a \"fountain of youth\" water cooler.\n\nOf course, you wouldn\u0027t be able to juggle all that if it weren\u0027t for the improved \"Free Will\" option, which makes it easier for Sims to fulfill their basic needs. The artificial intelligence of the game is noticeably improved; they won\u0027t turn on radios just as a family member is going to bed but, strangely, they do occasionally put their dishes on the floor.\n\nAnother big change in the series is the concept of the lifespan. Now Sims are born with the traits of their parents, families grow, and Sims grow old. Not only does this go hand in hand with aspirations (growing up is the first aspiration that a baby Sim will have), it provides a limited time with which your Sims can achieve their goals.\n\nThe pre-made households all have backstories that are smart spoofs of soap-opera plots--lots of scheming, romance, ghosts, and family fighting.",

You\u0027ll be able to control your Sims over their entire lifetimes, taking them from their first steps to their golden years.

And since every Sim will have its own DNA, their appearance and personality will be passed down through the generations. Life in The Sims 2 will take on a whole different dimension with an entirely new 3-D engine.",

The battle system uses many of the unique features of the Nintendo DS, including combat that takes place on both screens, and attacks performed by certain motions on the touchscreen or by shouting into the microphone.

    "summary": "The game incorporates the FedExCup championship format (a collection of tournaments) with rounds of golf at Westchester Country Club, TPC Boston, Cog Hill, and East Lake. The putt preview has been improved, allowing the player to simulate the ball\u0027s path once per individual spot, taking into accounts elements such as power, speed and elevation. On the Xbox 360 and the PS3, shots are not performed using the analog stick, but with the 3-point timed principle for start, power and accuracy. Shot Confidence is a new addition, keeping track of the player\u0027s performance on certain courses, for specific puts and using certain clubs. Great performances raise the confidence, which translates into experience and better performance on specific courses. Low confidence leads to lower accuracy, a pumping heartbeat, and rumbling controls on the Wii.\n\nOn the Wii, players can shake the controls to taunt the opponents with 4 different moves, to throw them off. It can be used to influence air conditions, spin, or adds audio distractions. The controls are available in 3 modes: Full Swing (wii remote), Sitting Swing (new, waggle the wii remote) or the classic controls using the nunchuck for analog play. In Full Swing, twisting the wii remote adds hooks and slices prior to shots. Also exclusive to the Wii is a Miniputt mode.",

For example, transforming as Starscream while flying will enable him to fly backwards as a robot to take out enemies behind the protagonist.\n\nFor multiplayer, at any point during a single-player campaign a friend can join in as a \"Remote Weapon System\", which allows them to shoot enemies, erect a shield to defend and transfer energon between both players.",
