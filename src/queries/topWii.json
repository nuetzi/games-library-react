The Master retreated to his sky palace to tend to his wounds and fell into a deep sleep.

As the game progresses, the Master defeats Tanzra\u0027s lieutenants and recovers his powers by rebuilding the civilizations of his people and communicating with them through prayer. After all lieutenants have been slain, the Master commences an assault on Tanzra\u0027s stronghold, Death Heim, eventually defeating him.\n\nAfter the defeat of Tanzra, The Master and his servant revisit the many civilizations that they had helped to build and observe the people. During their observations, they note that nobody is at the temple worshiping the Master. The servant observes that, although the people once prayed to the Master in times of trouble, they no longer feel a need to because they are not in danger.

However, unlike many other games, such as Puzzle Bobble, where the goal is to eliminate objects of certain colors or shapes, Cubello continues to provide the player with cubes colors that are either still in the magazine or on the stage, so the player has to calculate to have the color disappear from the magazine and the stage at the same time to win. There is also a \"Bonus Mode\" on the slot machine device that gives the player unlimited cubes to shoot of one color, or \"Super Bonus Mode\" which gives cubes of different colors depending on where they are launched at. \n \nYou also lose cubes in the magazine if the Cubello bumps into the screen towards you. \n \nThe game features an endless play mode in addition to players progressing through increasingly more difficult stages.",

Go for 1st place or a high score!\nArt Style: light trax takes racing to whole new (and very surreal) levels as you control a white beam of light moving perpetually forward while your viewpoint shifts between 2-D and 3-D perspectives.\n\nStart by choosing one of the two main modes of game play, each with its own distinct goal. In light tours mode, you vie with other light beams for the most points in a three-course racing tour. Watch out for obstacles, use items, and strategically use your dash ability to finish first. In freeway mode, your objective is to set a high score by traveling the greatest distance within a set amount of time. Mastering the intricacies of each setting is crucial: you’ll have to alternate between them in order to progress through the game and unlock all of its modes.\n\nWith precise controls packed in and a driving techno soundtrack, Art Style: light trax offers an experience unlike any other. Are you ready to compete in a mind-bending race at the speed of light?",

    "summary": "In Orbient, players control a white star. The game starts with the white star able to take 5 hits before it is destroyed. To make it grow, the player must collide his/her star with a similar-sized, blue star. Stars smaller than the player\u0027s star are gray-colored. Colliding with these stars will not change the white star\u0027s size, but if the player positions the white star just right, the gray star will orbit the white and become a satellite. Red stars are bigger than the white. The white star is able to orbit red stars to help travel through space. Whenever the white star grows large enough, the target star glows orange, and is able to be a satellite; as soon as that happens, a small crescent star appears, and having it successfully orbit the white star will give the player bonus points, (and collecting all different crescent stars unlocks new galaxies and are the goal to complete the game 100%). Colliding with the orange star will take away a hit, but having it orbit the white star will clear the round. The player guides the star by pressing the A and B buttons on the Wii Remote to utilize gravity and anti-gravity, respectively, and attract it towards or repel against (also respectively) the gravitational wells of celestial objects. Players must be careful not to crash their star into the red stars or floating objects like asteroids, or be sucked into black holes, which takes away a hit (and in the case of black holes, restart the entire stage).",

The game is structurally similar to Guitar Hero 5, and supports full band play (lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals) including the drop-in/drop-out and in-song instrument and difficulty change menus, and additional multiplayer modes as Guitar Hero 5. The console versions use instrument-shaped game controllers, while the DS version uses either the \"Guitar Grip\" introduced with the Guitar Hero: On Tour series or a new Drum Skin that comes with the game. Like previous games, virtual avatars of Taylor Swift, Adam Levine, and the band No Doubt are presented in the game. \n \nBand Hero received mixed reviews from journalists. Some considered the game to be an appropriately flavored version of Guitar Hero 5 for the \"Top 40\" pop rock hits, while others felt the game was strictly aimed at teenagers. They also contested the cost of the full game, featuring only 65 songs compared with 85 songs in Guitar Hero 5, and considered if the content would have been better in downloadable form. A day after the game\u0027s release, the band No Doubt sued Activision, citing similar misuse of their avatars as the Kurt Cobain avatar in Guitar Hero 5.",

    "storyline": "Bases Loaded introduced a unique depiction of the batter-pitcher matchup, emanating the typical views seen on television coverage of baseball. This allowed the player a more realistic feel, and made Bases Loaded into one of the most popular baseball games for early NES.\nThe league was made of fictitious teams, as it was difficult to achieve a license from the MBA, and included 12 American cities with unique players on each team. One unique feature that the game included was that each team had one batter who would charge the mound when provoked by the pitcher.",
    "summary": "Bases Loaded is a baseball game that was released for Arcade and the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987. It was developed by Jaleco and TOSE, and was the first installment in the Bases Loaded series, which was followed by seven sequels for three generations of consoles. The game tried to focus on the confrontation between the pitcher and the batter, putting emphasis on the face-off between the two. Unfortunately, this made the perspective fairly limited in determining where to hit the ball, or even where the ball was during a pitch.",

The Wii Remote is used to target and fire, but selecting and ordering units is performed through conventional button presses. The Wii Nunchuk\u0027s thumbstick controls player movement, and evasive maneuvers are handled through gestures.\n\nIn the single-player campaign mode, the player assumes control of the various factions at different points in the conflict\u0027s history. The game also features three online multiplayer modes. Skirmish mode is a timed two-player match to score more points than the other player by destroying opposing units. Assault mode is a timed two-player match in which one player attempts to destroy the other player\u0027s resources and fortifications while the other defends. Co-Op mode is an untimed two-player match in which both players work together to complete special online missions that are not part of the single-player campaign. Offline local multiplayer is not supported.",

The crew of the Odysseus have been frozen in cryogenic tanks for hundreds of years, and now the onboard computer has awakened them.\n\nComputer probes show that conditions on Avalon are hostile but livable.

You can also choose from three difficulty levels - Junior, College and Pro.\nThroughout the game, you\u0027ll constantly be tested by every intense element of championship hockey, from Penalty and Overtime Scenes to Knockout Smash-Hit Fight Scenes. Speed, strength, quickness and instinct are talents you must possess if you plan to prevail, especially when the anger flares, gloves come off and fists start flying.\n\nIt\u0027s hard hitting action at its toughest. And you\u0027ll soon learn that in this league nothing\u0027s ever given to you, and before you can reach your goals - you have to score them. You\u0027ve gotta master the artful skill of a finesse player and the bone crushing brutality of an enforcer. You\u0027d better be versatile as well, because you must skillfully control your forwards, centers, defensemen and even the goalie, who\u0027ll defend the net against unrelenting Power Plays (which will occur if you lose a fight and have your battered carcass banned to the Penalty Box).",

Becoming Master Bonk dresses Bonk in a cape and provides him with Vulcan-esque ears, and gives him the ability to move faster and jump higher. Becoming Hungry Bonk gives Bonk an animalistic appearance with evil eyes and a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth, and gives bonk the ability to chew enemies to death, as well as providing him with a much stronger head-butt that can kill nearby foes. Becoming Stealth Bonk dresses Bonk in a striped jail outfit, and gives him the ability to enter special locked doors that lead to areas such as the bank, where Bonk can collect Smileys, the butcher\u0027s, where Bonk can eat more slabs of meat in hope for a different power-up, and jail, where Bonk loses a portion of his Smileys.\n\nGrabbing one of many tulips scattered throughout the game carries Bonk to a special bonus stage where he can face off against Mechabonk -- a RoboCop-esque version of Bonk—in a best-of-three battle to \"bonk\" one another off the edge of a small stage. Winning two rounds provides Bonk with an extra life, while a loss transforms Bonk into Wounded Bonk, where Bonk resembles a mummy and takes twice as much damage as usual.\n\nThe game overall is very similar to games in the Mario series, providing linear, side-scrolling action, multiple power-ups, and several small boss confrontations leading up to a final boss. Its treatment of power-ups is similar as well: taking a hit while powered-up causes Bonk to take no damage but instead lose his power. For those who struggle with the game, the game offers passwords after game-overs so the player does not need to start over from the beginning.",

Unfortunately, sans flight plan and going into a storm, the plane crash lands near Katmai Mountain and forces the pilot to venture into an adventure to survive and escape the mountain alive and with their important cargo intact. Wild animals such as bears, wolves, cougars and even birds threaten survival, and require the pilot to dredge up any hunting and survival skills he has. \n \nThe game is designed to be compatible with the Top Shot Elite gun peripheral, and as such, there is a targeting cursor onscreen that the player uses to hunt or even use some equipment, with all the aiming done manually with the Top Shot Elite. With a controller, the targeting cursor is controlled in a manner similar to a Third-Person Shooter. The player has the ability to perform \"Focus Shots\" which slow down time and allow for visible placement of internal organs of the animal being hunted or defended against.",

The demons and abominations of nature who reside in the underground kingdom of Cadash have not forgotten that, thousands of years previously, they once shared the light with humans. Then one rose among them who was especially powerful, a demonic wizard born of a human woman – the Balrog (Baarogue or Baalogue in the arcade version, and Barlog in the TurboGrafx version). The Balrog promised his followers they could, in time, emerge from their subterranean prison and rule the world of men, taking revenge on humans for their prior defeat in battle and subsequent exile, if the Balrog could mingle his blood with that of a human king. The Balrog and his demonic armies gathered in force over the centuries, and are now powerful enough to emerge to the surface and make war with the unprepared human kingdoms which had not known war for millennia, all of which quickly fall to the Balrog. The human world is almost entirely laid to waste by the Balrog. However, this was not enough for the Balrog, whose prize is the mightiest of all human kingdoms, the Kingdom of Dirzir. One night, the beautiful Princess Salassa is kidnapped by the Balrog from the Keep of Deerzar, the capital city of Dirzir, and taken underground to the dreaded Castle Cadash. There the Balrog plans to initiate the ritual which would magically bind himself to the human princess, becoming all-powerful and invincible. Dilsarl, the distraught and helpless elderly King of Dirzir, has vowed to give his entire kingdom to the one who would rescue his beloved only daughter, and many brave heroes have disappeared into the depths of Cadash on this quest.",
    "summary": "Cadash is an early example of what would become a fairly common trend in Japanese-made arcade games of the early 1990s: the \"platform-RPG\". Cadash borrows many principles of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link\u0027s gameplay, combining side-scrolling platform action with an RPG system of statistics, levels, money and magic.\n\nFour characters can play at once in the arcade version, and up to two players may select from four different characters in the console versions: fighter, mage, priestess, and ninja, each with different attacks, statistics and skills. Players then proceed through each level, killing monsters and bosses, collecting keys to unlock doors and collecting gold and experience. Gold is also taken from slain foes and treasure chests. Villages sell items, weapons, armor and (in the console versions) extra lives, with each village encountered providing better equipment. Some villagers and benevolent creatures will also provide information. The arcade version has a limited game time, which can be extended by buying progressively more expensive hourglasses at shops, or by picking up rare bonuses. In shops, and in hidden places, are medicinal herbs which restore 10 HP if brought to zero, and antidotes which cure poison inflicted by specific foes. There are also two elixirs in the game that act like medicinal herbs, except that they restore all HP.\n\nThere are five stages in the game. Stages one, two and four consist of two worlds, above and below ground. Stage three consists of three worlds. Stage five is set entirely within Castle Cadash. The environments differ significantly, from pleasant meadows to caves, and from forests to underwater environments. Some foes encountered in these levels are derived from common mythology while others are completely made up for the game.",

    "summary": "Introducing the gnarliest bunch of games under the sun. Games invented on the beaches by sun-baked beach bums with a fondness for ripping, grinding, and shredding. With six radically thrilling events intended to bring you to the edge and blow your mind. And make adrenaline California\u0027s most plentiful natural resource.\n\nWish they all could be California Games.\nGet ready to shred the face off an awesomely tubular wave. Turn a \"berm\" on a BMX bike and spray up a wall of dirt. Launch a few feet off-the-lip with your skateboard tucked high. And while you\u0027re up there, dance for the crowd. Or if you\u0027re feeling like kicking back a bit, float a flying disk, juggle a foot bag with your heels, or just slalom the boardwalk on skates.\n\nWhen the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.\nBut this ain\u0027t beach blanket bingo. In fact, before you even set foot on California turf, you\u0027ll choose an on-screen sponsor from among the heaviest names on the circuit. Then, hit the competition route. Prizes include trophies for a single event and a top prize in overall competition.\n\nSo get air. Go crazy. Welcome to a new state of intensity.\n\nCalifornia Games was the original \"Extreme Games\" – what today\u0027s generation might call \"X-Games in the sun\". Players can select sponsors (absent in some versions) and compete in events such as skateboarding, footbag, surfing, roller skating, flying disc (frisbee) and BMX. The surfing event is ranked by judges, which give a score to help the players improve their routine.\n\nThe Atari versions (2600 and Lynx) of the game omit the flying disc and roller skating events, while the Genesis version omits only the flying disc event.",

Much of the campaign is told through the eyes of SOG and CIA operative Alex Mason, primarily through flashbacks. Mason awakens strapped to a chair in a room filled with monitors, bombarded with questions by two unknown interrogators about a numbers broadcast. Mason then recalls several events from the past in an attempt to answer their questions, setting up the missions of the game.",

Luckily, you command the role of Trevor - Simon\u0027s forefather and the origin of the Belmont Warlord Chromosomes.

Trevor also has the strength and wisdom to command the Battle Axe, Invisibility Potion and Mystic Whip. But the most important weapon Trevor has is your cunning to choose the correct Paths of Fate and your bravery to lead him past 17 possible levels of never-ending doom, including the Haunted Ship of Fools, the Sunken City of Poltergeists, the Clock Tower of Untimely Death and Curse Castle.

    "storyline": "The player character awakens in a cave with no memory of how he came to be there. He finds a village of Mimigas, who are being persecuted by the Doctor. The Doctor\u0027s servants Misery and Balrog are looking for Sue Sakamoto, a girl who had been transformed into a Mimiga. Not finding her, they mistakenly abduct another Mimiga named Toroko instead. The player finds Sue in the Egg Corridor, where she discovers the eggs of a Sky Dragon, which could allow her to escape the floating island if hatched. Sue attempts to rescue her brother Kazuma, but King, the leader of Mimiga Village, captures her and holds her responsible for Toroko\u0027s kidnapping. Sue tasks the player with retrieving Kazuma from Grasstown. After freeing him, they meet Professor Booster, who reveals that the Doctor plans to use the red flowers on Mimigas to create an army to take over the surface world. Booster sends the player to the Sand Zone to destroy the red flowers before the Doctor can find them. While there, the player meets Curly Brace, a female robot who also has no memories of her past, and Jenka, an old witch who is Misery\u0027s mother and guardian of the red flowers. Jenka calls the player character a \"soldier from the surface\", one of many who were sent to the island to slaughter the Mimigas.\n\nMisery transports the player to the Labyrinth deep inside the island as punishment for interfering with the Doctor\u0027s plans. Curly Brace has also been thrown into the Labyrinth and they cooperate to escape. Balrog helps them to move the boulder blocking the exit, revealing his kind nature. The pair find and defeat the Core, a magical creature whose power keeps the island afloat. However, the Doctor steps in to save it before the island collapses. Depending on certain conditions, the player may rescue Curly Brace, who had sacrificed her air tank to save the player character. When he returns to Mimiga Village, he finds that the Doctor has captured the Mimigas. In the Egg Corridor, Kazuma offers the player a choice to escape the island with him using a Sky Dragon, leading to an alternate ending in which the Doctor conquers the surface world while Kazuma and the player hide in the mountains. The player may instead choose to confront the Doctor and destroy the island\u0027s Core, which would return the Mimigas to normal. The player scales the outer wall of the island to reach the Plantation where the Doctor is using the Mimigas as slave laborers to grow red flowers. The Doctor\u0027s servants capture him and place him in a jail cell with Sue. She is taken away before the player wakes up, but her letter reveals that the Doctor was a member of the research expedition that included Sue\u0027s family and Professor Booster, but he betrayed them once he found the Demon Crown. Sue directs the player to find her mother who may have a plan to stop the Doctor.\n\nIf the player saved Curly Brace earlier, the player may find an item to restore her memories. She remembers that the player character\u0027s name is Quote, and that they were not the killer robots who slaughtered Mimigas in the past. Instead, they were sent to destroy the Demon Crown to prevent its power from falling into the wrong hands. Quote finds Sue\u0027s mother, Momorin, who is building a rocket that will allow access to the top of the island where the Doctor resides. After helping her complete the rocket, Quote confronts Misery and the Doctor. The Doctor has purified the essence of the red flowers into a crystal, which allows him to survive even after Quote destroys his body. The Doctor\u0027s spirit possesses the Core of the island, but Quote succeeds in destroying that as well, causing the island to begin falling to Earth. Under certain conditions, the player may proceed into a bonus stage called the Bloodstained Sanctuary where the creator of the Demon Crown, Ballos, is imprisoned. Ballos, Jenka\u0027s brother, was a powerful wizard who went insane after being tortured. Misery forced Ballos to create the Demon Crown, but she and Balrog became cursed to serve whoever possessed it. With the help of Curly Brace, Quote defeats Ballos and stops the source of the negative energy that was causing the island to fall, saving its inhabitants. Balrog saves the two before they are crushed by Ballos\u0027 collapsing prison—he had been sent by Misery as thanks for breaking her curse. Quote, Curly Brace, and Balrog leave the island to live out their days in peace.",

    "storyline": "Sketch Turner, a \"starving artist\" and freelance rock musician living in New York City, is working on his newest comic book, Comix Zone. It is the story of the New World Empire\u0027s attempt to defend Earth from an invasion of alien renegades, with inspiration coming from Sketch\u0027s oddly vivid dreams and nightmares. One night, while Sketch is working on Comix Zone during a thunderstorm, a lightning bolt strikes a panel of his comic. In this instant, its main villain, a powerful mutant named Mortus, escapes the comic book\u0027s pages, desiring to kill Sketch so he can become flesh and blood and take over the real world. Because he does not possess any power in reality, Mortus sends Sketch into the world of his own comic, freely drawing in enemies attempting to kill him.\n\nInside the comic book, Sketch meets General Alissa Cyan, who believes he is \"the chosen one\" who came to save their post-apocalyptic world from the evil of Mortus and the alien invaders. Ignoring Sketch\u0027s protests, Alissa sends him on his mission, keeping in touch with instructions and hints via radio. It is up to Sketch to stop Mortus\u0027s evil plans and find a way out of this comic world.\n\nThe game has two possible endings. At the end of the game, Alissa attempts to defuse a nuclear weapon that Mortus and the Mutants plan on using to wipe out the New World Empire and humanity, when Mortus comes back into the comic and throws her into the chamber, which starts to fill up with liquid. Mortus then battles Sketch personally. If the player defeats Mortus and the Kreeps he summons as he takes damage quickly enough to drain the liquid and save Alissa before the nuke self-destructs, an ending occurs where Alissa comes to the real world with Sketch and Roadkill and joins the army, eventually becoming Chief of Security for the United States. Roadkill is given a vast amount of mozzarella cheese, and spends a lot of time exploring the city\u0027s new sewer system when not sleeping under a pile of Sketch\u0027s dirty socks. Comix Zone becomes an instant sensation, selling out on the first day, making Sketch famous as it becomes the best-selling comic book ever.\n\nDefeating Mortus after the chamber fills with liquid, Alissa dies as the nuke self-destructs. Sketch and Roadkill come out, but Sketch\u0027s comic is destroyed, leaving him devastated at having saved the New World Empire, but failed to save Alissa.",

In most phases there is also a mini-bosses, this is very easy to defeat.\n\nThe gameplay is excellent, the joystick commands respond perfectly, the characters shoot in any direction, lay on the floor, jump, scale the wall, do almost everything.

Failing to accomplish a step in Let\u0027s Cook mode or getting a \"fail\" within steps (in various ranges), the player will receive a \"Broken Silver\" medal, in which the medal is similar to that of the Silver medal with an addition: a crack. Unlike in previous Cooking Mama titles, bonuses earned during minigames do not influence the overall score, but instead accumulate as \"bonus stars\".

This new idea is perfectly designed to appeal to both DDR novices and hardened dancers alike, and adds new depth to the classic gameplay. Furthermore, owners of Nintendos Wii Balance Board can use it instead of a dance mat, with the board registering complete body movement. \n \nDanceDanceRevolution hottest party 4 allows up to four players to get together and compete against each other, and can be bought with a dance mat controller or a solus title, and enjoys a stunning collection of suitably high-tempo tracks. The new game offers 20 licensed tunes, including Lady Gagas classic Bad Romance, Paramores CrushCrushCrush and the classic Celebration from Kool and the Gang. There are also more than 30 specially-created tunes from KONAMIs in-house team, all of which are designed to test the players co-ordination and rhythm. \n \nWith a wealth of game modes - including the eternally popular Calorie Counter system so users can watch the pounds drop off as they dance! - DanceDanceRevolution hottest party 4 is a stunning party game that absolutely anyone can enjoy.",

    "summary": "Devil World is a maze video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released in Japan on October 5, 1984 and in Europe on July 15, 1987. The game was also released on the Wii\u0027s Virtual Console in Japan on January 22, 2008 and in Europe and Australia on October 31, 2008. The game has similar gameplay to that of Pac-Man. It is the only game designed by Shigeru Miyamoto that has not been released in North America, despite the fact that the game is simple and in English. This was due to Nintendo of America\u0027s strict policies on the use of religious icons in games, which were at their strictest level at the time of the game\u0027s original release.",

The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves). Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.",

Players who are fond of traditional control schemes may also use a point-and-click style with hotkeys to aid Flo in her quest for customer satisfaction, which is reflected in a heart meter that empties as customers lose patience.

    "summary": "DJ Hero primarily simulates turntablism, a musical style used by disc jockeys to create a new mashup song by incorporating one or more previously recorded songs played on record players along with sound effect generators. The game features score attack gameplay similar to the Guitar Hero games. The controller consists of a wireless deck consisting of a movable turntable that supports 3 \"stream\" buttons, an effects dial, a crossfader, and a \"Euphoria\" button; a hidden panel contains additional controller buttons to interact with the gaming console outside of the game. A portion of the controller can be detached and reattached to adapt the unit for left-handed players. Notes travel in an arc across a spinning record on screen, and the player holds down one of the 3 stream buttons to play notes; two buttons reflect the two songs used in that particular mix, and the third represents samples to add to the mix which can be adjusted with the effects dial. The player must also constantly adjust the crossfader to match onscreen symbols, which alters the relative volume of the songs as to bring one song to the forefront of the mix for a short time. Certain tracks are shown on screen as a series of up or down arrow, representing scratching sections, requiring the player to turn the turntable in the direction of the arrows while holding down the button to score points, mimicking the scratching of the record needle on vinyl albums. \"Euphoria\" is equivalent to Guitar Hero\u0027s Star Power, collected by successfully completing specific phrases in the song mix, called Perfect Regions, and can be released by pressing the Euphoria button, doubling the player\u0027s current multiplier as well as automatic crossfading when active. There is also a \"Rewind\" meter that builds through consistent successful playing, and once full, allows the player to rewind the song to fix errors in their performance. The player must continue to perform well or their performance meter will drop and the music track will cut out. Failing the song is not possible, unlike in Guitar Hero games.\n\nA single player career mode is available, as well both competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes (\"DJ vs DJ\"), playable locally or remotely. Ten songs have been specially mixed to also support gameplay with Guitar Hero and other compatible guitar controllers in a \"DJ vs Guitar\" mode. Players can also use a microphone for a non-scoring addition to the mix. A Party Play mode allows the game to automatically play the songs with the ability for a player to jump in and play at any time.",

DK entrusts Diddy with protecting the hoard until midnight, when he would be relieved, while DK himself goes to sleep as he is tired.\n\nEverything seems to go smoothly in the hoard until Diddy hears some noises. Diddy hears some voices outside and gets scared, asking who\u0027s there. King K. Rool, who had commanded his Kremling minions to steal the bananas. Two ropes drop from above and suddenly two Kritters appear. Diddy cartwheels them both easily, but then a Krusha (Klump in the instruction booklet) comes in as backup. As Diddy is not strong enough to defeat Krusha by himself, he is overpowered and defeated by the Kremling. The lizars seal Diddy inside a barrel and then throw it in the bushes.\nDonkey\u0027s grandfather, Cranky Kong, rushes inside the treehouse to tell Donkey Kong to wake up so he may tell him what happened. He then tells Donkey to check his Banana Cave. Donkey Kong is infuriated, exclaiming that the Kremlings will pay for stealing his banana hoard and kidnapping his little buddy. Donkey goes on to say that he will hunt every corner of the island for his bananas back.",

Cranky Kong goes up to him and complains how he never took breaks, \"whisking off maidens and throwing barrels seven days a week\", but Donkey ignores him, confident that he is a hero and that King K. Rool is gone for good. Cranky soon leaves.\n\nMeanwhile, above, Kaptain K. Rool, aboard his vessel, The Flying Krock, commands his minions to invade the island and take Donkey captive so that his next attempt at stealing the banana hoard will not be a failure and the hero will never mess with his plans again. Donkey, still lounging, did not notice the attack until Kutlasses ambushed him and took him prisoner. Kaptain K. Rool assures Donkey Kong that he will never see his precious island or his friends again.\n\nLater and back on the island, Diddy, Dixie and Cranky Kong find Donkey missing, along with a note. It reads:\nHah-arrrrh! We have got the big monkey! If you want him back, you scurvy dogs, you\u0027ll have to hand over the banana hoard!\nKaptain K. Rool\nAt this point, Wrinkly, Funky and Swanky Kong come to the scene.

Once again, the players assume the role of brothers Billy and Jimmy Lee, who are now tasked with the duty of avenging Marian\u0027s death.",
    "summary": "The arcade version of the game is essentially an improved version of the original title. The biggest change in the game\u0027s controls are in the replacement of the original\u0027s punch and kick buttons with two directional-based attack buttons (Left Attack and Right Attack) similar to Renegade. Pressing the attack button of the player\u0027s current direction will do a standard series of punches, while pressing the opposite attack button will perform a back kick. A few new moves are added as well, including a Hurricane Kick.\n\nLike in the original game, the arcade version of Double Dragon II is divided into four missions: a heliport, a lumber storehouse, a wheat field, and the new hideout of the boss. Each stage has its own boss character with his own theme. After defeating Willy (the final boss from the original game) in the fourth stage, the player will confront a double of their own character for the game\u0027s final battle. If two players reach the end together, then both will each to have to face their own clone for the final battle.",

One of the games was developed by 5th Cell for the Nintendo DS, while the other was created by Planet Moon Studios for the Wii.[1][\n\nThe game begins with a surreal sequence, wherein an unknown party asks the player “What do you remember about that day?” The player is given several dialogue choices that build a cohesive description of \"that day\", though at this time, the player is not aware of the event\u0027s importance (or even occurrence). Before the game properly begins, the player is asked to draw an image depicting this mysterious scene, introducing them to the game\u0027s core \"draw\" functionality.\n\nFollowing this is an animation sequence wherein one of the characters from the previous game, Heather, recovers from a nightmare. She is shown to possess a red-colored jewel pendant. In the same sequence, Heather is abducted by a darkness which emanated from a scepter she discovered in a beached treasure chest in the middle of the night. The next morning, when the other characters realize she\u0027s missing, a search for her is dramatically cut short by Wilfre, who causes the majority of the Raposa villagers to vanish, reveals himself as Heather\u0027s captor, and ultimately drains the Village of color. The remaining characters flee to the back of a massive turtle delivered, upon request, by the Creator.\n\nTheir numbers sorely reduced and their home ruined, the game follows the Raposa\u0027s struggle to reunite with their fellows and, with the aid of the Creator\u0027s Hero of Creation, defeat Wilfre before he can realize his as-yet unknown goals. The remaining members of the Village travel to Watersong, Lavasteam, the Galactic Jungle, and Wilfre\u0027s Wasteland, a combination of all three villages. At Watersong, Mari and Jowee meet Sock, who is an important character later in the story.",

    "storyline": "T.K is a 18-year old kid who just arrived from the countryside to New York City, \"looking to make good\". Using his driving skills, he becomes known in the underworld as a wheelman and a getaway driver for robbers assaulting \"nickel and dime\" stores. He lives with his childhood friend Ray, who himself arrived in 1975 and after a short career as a wheelman, set up Ray\u0027s Autos tuning garage. T.K spends his time relaxing in Ray\u0027s room, racing and doing various odd jobs around town, stating that \"after a couple of weeks, it felt like home.\"\n\nRay, wishing to move on up the criminal ladder, introduces T.K to Slink, owner of a popular club in Harlem, and he proves himself to him by doing some work for him and handling his skills with a gun. He is also introduced to a gangster known as The Mexican, whom he helps with his driving skills by delivering packages across the city and proving himself against the last driver, whom The Mexican has locked in his trunk as a punishment. Later on, he is also introduced to a local criminal called Bishop, who requests from T.K to infiltrate Riker\u0027s Island and smuggle out Candy, a local gangster jailed there. Meanwhile, T.K also helps Ray with his gambling debt by doing other odd jobs across the city to pay him off.\n\nAfter meeting up with Slink, Bishop, The Mexican and Candy, he is introduced to Corrigan, a corrupt police officer who doubles as a drug dealer. Since cocaine has a large foothold on the New York drug market and will be a rising star in the 1980s, Corrigan\u0027s organization wishes to gain leverage over cocaine distribution, but their main issue is Rafael Martinez, a Colombian drug lord who holds a monopoly on the drug trade, so they plan to have him kidnapped and held for ransom, which will be used to start a prominent drug trade. After setting up an elaborate ambush, in which Candy proves crucial with his planning skills, they successfully kidnap him. After the Colombian Cartel relents and provides ransom, T.K is collected and escapes the Cartel\u0027s men across rooftops, with The Mexican providing cover for him. After the ransom is delivered to Corrigan, he suddenly shoots Martinez dead, while the rest of the gang leaves. Corrigan reveals that T.K is set to be the fall guy, he sells T.K out and shoots him. T.K survives, but is arrested, trialed and sentenced to 28 years in the notorious Sing-Sing prison.",
    "summary": "Diverging from previous Driver games, Parallel Lines takes place in just one city, New York, instead of multiple cities, but in the middle of the story you change to different eras of the city - 1978 and 2006. Due to the underwhelming performance of Driv3r, particularly the often-derided on-foot sections, Parallel Lines returns to the formula used in earlier games in the series, focusing on driving, although shooting remains in the game.",

Most of these heads have a time limit before the head returns to normal, with the player able to cancel at any time, though some heads, such as the Pin Head, disable manual cancellation.

It also features more diverse gameplay than the original, with each stage having a unique different style and mission, often with varied gameplay and objectives to complete from stage to stage, as well as various new weapons to obtain and use.\n\nThere are extra weapons in addition to the Plasma Blaster, such as the Three-Finger Gun, the Electro-Gun, Homing Missiles, the extremely powerful Barn Blaster, and the rather useless Bubble Gun. Snott returns from his cameos in the first game, and is now a permanent companion for Jim, hiding in the backpack of Jim\u0027s Super Suit. Snott can be used to stick and swing to other slimy green surfaces, or as a parachute, upon jumping.",

Innovative in gameplay, the game was very popular for many years.\n\nIn the game, the player assumes the role of a spy who infiltrates a building filled with elevators. He must collect secret documents from the building and traverse the 30 floors of the building using an increasingly complex series of elevators. The player is pursued by enemy agents who appear from behind closed doors. These agents must be dealt with via force or evasion. Successful completion of a level involves collecting all the secret documents and traversing the building from top to bottom. In the lower floors of the building, the elevator systems are so complex that some puzzle-solving skills are needed.\n\nThe game was available as a standard upright cabinet The controls consist of a 4-way joystick and two buttons, one for \"shoot\" and the other for jumping and kicking. The maximum number of players is two, alternating turns. The graphics are extremely simple, 2D color graphics and in-game music was composed by musician Yoshio Imamura. The game was followed by a sequel, Elevator Action II (also known as Elevator Action Returns).",

    "summary": "In this game you play the role of an endurance bike racer. The gameplay involves you racing against the clock to get to the finish line and jumping over ramps. At the end of each race you get points for how many cars or bikes you have overtaken with which you can upgrade your bike. There are various different terrain for you to race on including desert beach and dirt tracks plus a number of things to slow you down or even knock you off of your bike all together. The main idea is to find the best route through each level to shave off valuable seconds in order to over take more cars and bikes. \n \nThe Japanese version of the game has more Tracks than the European and US versions have. Among them is a snow track which is one of the hardest tracks in the game, because there is a lot of stones on the thin road.",

It is the first Family Feud video game to be released on Xbox 360 and the third to be developed on Wii by Ludia Inc.\n\nIn Family Feud, one hundred people were surveyed and gave answers to various questions. Two families then battle each other by trying to guess the top answers to each question. In each round, a member of each family is asked to join the host on the center of the stage to answer one question. The quickest player to buzz in gets to answer first. If he/she doesn\u0027t give the number one answer, the other player can give his/her answer as well. Whoever has the best answer will then decide to either \"play\" or \"pass\". If the player decides to play, his/her family will have to guess all the answers to win the round. If the player decides to pass, the opposing family will have to find all the answers. \n\nEach wrong answer results in a strike. After three strikes, the other family has a chance to steal the points. To do so, they must find one correct answer that hasn\u0027t already been given. When all the rounds are over, the family with the most points gets to play \"fast money\". In \"fast money\", the player is asked to answer the five same questions twice (or in multiplayer mode, two players can each answer the set of five questions). If the player gets 200 points or more in the \"fast money\" round, he/she wins $20 000!\n\nFamily Feud: 2012 Edition includes over 2000 survey questions, three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard), a party mode with up to 4 players, bonus videos featuring Steve Harvey and lets the player play as his/her avatar on Xbox 360 or Mii on Wii.\n\nIn challenge mode, 1 to 4 players can play cooperatively against 16 different families. Each family has its own themed alcove (a beach, a mansion, a spaceship, a prehistoric den, a haunted house, a private boat, a bowling alley, etc). In party mode, 2 to 4 players can compete against each other.\n\nKinect features were developed for the game on Xbox 360, but were eventually dropped as they didn\u0027t add any fun factor to the game. It was then decided to also port the game to Wii.",

Developed by EA Canada, it is published by Electronic Arts worldwide under the EA Sports label. It was released on all popular gaming formats in September 2007 in Europe, Australia, and Asia, and in October 2007 in North America. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game feature an improved game engine with superior graphics and different commentators and are dubbed \"next-generation\" by EA. On all other platforms—including the PC—the game utilizes an older engine. The Nintendo DS version features fewer teams, stadiums, game modes and kits due to the limitations of the machine\u0027s storage medium. \n \nCommentary comes from Sky Sports\u0027 Martin Tyler and Andy Gray on next generation consoles; however, ITV Sports\u0027 Clive Tyldesley partners Gray on current generation consoles, and the PC version of the game. On the DS version of the game, Tyldesley is by himself. It also marks the first time the Nintendo GameCube has been excluded from the FIFA lineup since FIFA 2001 and the first the original Xbox and Game Boy Advance has been excluded from the FIFA lineup since FIFA Football 2002. \n \nThe tagline for the game is \"Can You FIFA 08?.\"[2] The theme song is \"Sketches (20 Something Life)\" by La Rocca, from the album The Truth.",

The characters have a \"super-deformed\" touch. There is also voice acting during cut-scenes. A new option has been added to the menu, which allows the player to read a conversation between party members and receive advice from them.\n\nIt also features many gameplay additions. The difficulty level has been increased, not only beyond the difficulty of the Western SNES release (which was reduced compared to Japanese original and subsequent ports), but even beyond the original difficulty. The party members are still bound by class, but they can now hunt for so-called \"augments\", which can be found or stolen from enemies and which grant the characters additional bonus abilities, resistances, spells that their class would normally not allow, etc.\n\nBeside those major changes, there are also plenty of minor additions. It is possible to obtain bonus items after exploring every corner and filling 100% of an area map; Rydia, the summoner girl, has a new monster summon who can be customized in various ways; there is a new quest involving the \"naming\" moogle of the original game, etc.",

    "summary": "Final Fight is a side-scrolling beat-\u0027em-up produced by Capcom. Final Fight can be played by up to two players simultaneously. Before the game begins, the player chooses between the three main characters: Haggar, Cody, and Guy. Each has his own fighting style and attributes. Health gauges are displayed for both player and enemy characters.\n\nThe controls for Final Fight consist of an eight-way joystick and two buttons for attacking and jumping respectively. Pressing the attack button repeatedly when attacking an enemy or multiple enemies will cause the player character to perform a combo. The final blow of the combo can be changed to a throw if the player moves the joystick in the opposite direction just before landing it. The player can also perform a jump attack. Pressing the attack and jump buttons simultaneously allows the player to perform a special attack that strikes all surrounding enemies, but will drain a small portion of the player\u0027s health.\n\nEnemies can be grabbed simply by walking into one of them. When an enemy is grabbed, the player can perform a grab attack by pressing the attack button or perform a throw by tilting the joystick left or right. A thrown enemy can be tossed at another for additional damage. Items such as weapons, health recovery items, and items awarding extra points can be picked up by standing over one and pressing the attack button. Weapons have limited uses and will disappear if the player is disarmed by an enemy too much or when the player moves to a new area.\n\nFinal Fight consists of six stages or \"rounds\", as well as two bonus rounds. Each round takes place in a different section of Metro City such as the Slums and the Subway, with most rounds featuring more than one level. At the end of each round the player will face a boss character unique to that round.",

Tackle problems and defeat enemies to reveal magical Rainbow Drops, each of which will restore some of Aquaticus\u0027 power and allow it to open more chapters and grant you new powers. These additional powers, such as sticking to objects as a block of ice or shooting bolts of lightning as a steam cloud, will be essential to destroying the Influence and its minions. Along the way, you can also test your ingenuity and reflexes by finding hidden puzzle pieces. These pieces unlock playrooms that give you the opportunity to use the skills you\u0027ve learned and race against the clock to complete as many challenges as possible. These challenges won\u0027t affect your quest to restore Aquaticus\u0027 powers, but everyone needs a break now and again, right?

Young Seto finds a note from his deceased grandfather urging him to travel to the red tower that lights up the night sky. Along the way he finds a young, silver haired girl Ren who drives him to journey through the ruined world in search of companionship.\n\nFragile Dreams: Farewell Ruins of the Moon is an action-adventure game with light RPG elements and a focus on exploring the often desolate surroundings. Players are tasked with navigating the empty environments while fighting ghosts and obtaining items such as sketches and short stories that reveal the last moments of the lives of those lost in the great catastrophe. Seto is guided through a third-person perspective and the flashlight is one of his most important aids. Controlled through the Wii Remote it illuminates dark surroundings to interact with the environment and is needed to solve many puzzles. It can also uncover hidden enemies and often a sound through the mini speaker provides a hint about their location.\n\nThe Nunchuck is used to walk, sneak around, and crouch. It is possible to go into a first-person perspective to get a better view of the environment. Additional weapons that can be picked up during the course of the game are sticks, an iron pipe, a bow, a hammer, a bamboo sword, and a katana.",

    "storyline": "The game takes place in the fictional land of Yuria, a Conan the Barbarian-style high fantasy medieval world. An evil entity known as Death Adder has captured the King and his daughter, and holds them captive in their castle. He also finds the Golden Axe, the magical emblem of Yuria, and threatens to destroy both the axe and the royal family unless the people of Yuria accept him as their ruler. Three warriors set out on a quest to rescue Yuria and avenge their losses at the hands of Death Adder. The first is a battle axe-wielding dwarf, Gilius Thunderhead, from the mines of Wolud, whose twin brother was killed by the soldiers of Death Adder. Another is a male barbarian, Ax Battler, wielding a two-handed broadsword, looking for revenge for the murder of his mother. The last is a longsword-wielding Tyris Flare, an amazon, whose parents were both killed by Death Adder.\n\nThe warriors rescue the inhabitants of the ransacked Turtle Village, which turns out to be situated on the shell of a giant turtle. The turtle takes the characters across the sea, and they then fly to the castle itself on the back of a giant eagle. Once at the castle they defeat Death Adder, who is wielding the Golden Axe, and save the land. In the Mega Drive and PC versions, and also in other ports, the characters also battle Death Adder\u0027s mentor, Death Bringer, as the true final boss. After the final battle, the warriors receive a magical golden axe that imbues the player with immortality.",
    "summary": "Progress is made through the game by fighting through Death Adder\u0027s henchmen, including men armed with clubs and maces, skeleton warriors, and knights. Players are able to attack using their weapon, jump and cast spells that hurt all enemies on the screen. The force of this magic depends on the number of \"bars\" of magic power currently available. The bars are filled by collecting blue \u0027magic potions\u0027 attained by kicking little sprites who then drop the potions. These sprites appear during regular levels and during bonus stages in between levels. The male warrior Ax is able to cast earth spells. The dwarf Gilius, casts lightning spells and the female warrior Tyris casts fire magic. Each character has a different number of maximum magic bars and varying ranges of attack.\n\nVarious steeds known as bizarrians are found in the game. These can be ridden when the enemy rider is knocked off, or if one is found dormant. The least powerful steed is known as the Cockatrice, which can be used to knock down enemies with a swipe of its tail. The more powerful dragon, which can either shoot fireballs or breathe fire, is found later in the game.",

The mission goes awry when Trevelyan is shot by General Ourumov. Bond escapes by detonating explosives he had placed throughout the facility before fleeing Arkhangelsk via aeroplane.\n\nLater, a phone call intercepted from Ourumov connects him to Russian gangster Valentin Zukovsky as Ourumov attempts to acquire a helicopter that has been modified to survive an electromagnetic pulse. Zukovsky directs him to an arms fair in Dubai but is unable to stop Onatopp and Ourumov from stealing the helicopter. However, he is able to plant his smartphone on board, and MI6 is able to track the helicopter to a remote base in Siberia. Bond is unable to stop the theft of a GoldenEye weapons satellite which is detonated by Ourumov. Bond is able to rescue Natalya Simonova before being arrested by the Russian army.\n\nBelieving Bond and Simonova to be responsible for the GoldenEye blast, Russian Defense Minister Dmitri Mishkin interrogates the two in Saint Petersburg, but is killed by Ourumov, who then abducts Natalya. Bond pursues him to a train and confronts him over his plan for the GoldenEye satellite. Onatopp betrays Ourumov and kills him. Bond is able to help Natalya off the train and goes to a meeting at Statue Park learning that Trevelyan survived his execution at the hands of Ourumov and is now Janus, the mastermind behind the GoldenEye theft and leaves with Natalya, who is instrumental to his plan. Bond is able to infiltrate a solar facility in northwestern Nigeria and tricks Trevelyan into destroying his supercomputers stopping his plan to use the satellite to destroy London erasing evidence of finances he stole.

    "summary": "Guitar Hero 5 (initially referred to as Guitar Hero V) is a music rhythm game and the fifth main entry in the Guitar Hero series. The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision, and released internationally in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, 3 and Wii consoles. Similar to the preceding title, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers. Guitar Hero 5 adds several new features, such as drop-in/drop-out play, bands composed of any combination of available instruments, a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms, and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars, clothing, and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience, allowing players across a range of skill levels to be able to play cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online. \n \nGuitar Hero 5\u0027s track list contains 85 songs by 83 separate artists, and like previous Guitar Hero games, several musicians with works in the game have been modeled through motion capture for playable characters in the game, including Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Matthew Bellamy, and Kurt Cobain. Players can also create their own character and instrument to play with. The game continues to support the user-created music studio introduced in World Tour through GHTunes, and additional downloadable content for the game was also made available. A majority of existing downloadable tracks from World Tour are forward-compatible with Guitar Hero 5, along with selected on-disc tracks from World Tour and Guitar Hero Smash Hits, and songs from the game could also be exported for a fee to play in its sequel, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, and spin-off game Band Hero. \n \nThe game was well received by reviewers, who appreciated the improvements in the accessibility of the game, allowing players to immediately jump in and play without spending excessive time in the game\u0027s menus. The game also sold well, however, it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour\u0027s sales, specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms. Improvements to both the Career and competitive multiplayer modes were also highlights of the game. However, the game\u0027s track list was considered to be too broad, and controversy arose over the ability to use the avatar of Kurt Cobain to perform in any other song within the game.",

The game was released in North America on the PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360 on March 29, 2009 and on PlayStation 2 on April 14, 2009, with an Australian and European release in May 2009. Guitar Hero: Metallica is the second game of the Guitar Hero series to focus on the career and songs of one band following Guitar Hero: Aerosmith. \n \nThe game is based on Guitar Hero World Tour, with support for lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game has many of the same features from World Tour, including single-player and band Career modes, online competitive modes, and the ability to create and share songs through \"GHTunes\". In addition to the normal difficulty levels presented in Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero: Metallica provides an \"Expert+\" difficulty for drums that allows the use of a second bass drum pedal to match the drumming style of Metallica\u0027s Lars Ulrich. The game features 28 master recordings spanning Metallica\u0027s career and an additional 21 songs selected by members of Metallica. The band performed extensive motion capture for the game for their in-game avatars and performances. The game includes several extras including behind-the-scenes videos of the motion capture sessions, tour and concert videos of the band, and Pop-Up Video-like facts for many of the songs on the game disc. \n \nGuitar Hero: Metallica received positive reviews, with critics stating it to be a strong tribute to the band and Neversoft\u0027s best work on the Guitar Hero series to date. The difficulty throughout the game was praised, found to be more enjoyable to players of all skill levels than the more-difficult Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. Reviewers noted the lack of additional downloadable content, save for the pre-existing Death Magnetic songs, the cartoonish storyline for the Career mode, and the overall value of the game as some of the negatives to the experience.",

Following the release of Rock Band that built on the Guitar Hero concept but added additional instruments, World Tour introduces these as well to allow players to play together simultaneously as a real band. Next to the guitar that was the main peripheral for the previous titles, the bundled edition of the game adds a microphone for the vocal parts and drums for percussion. Just like the previous game, the guitar tracks are split up for the lead and bass. The lyrics and the vocal pitch is shown near the top of the screen, while the bottom part is split up for bass guitar, lead guitar and drums, each with a separate set of notes that need to be hit to correctly play the part.",

    "storyline": "The play and mechanics of Ice Hockey are mostly similar to that of ice hockey in real life. The objective for both team is to hit a black puck with a hockey stick that each player carries into the opponent\u0027s goal. Teams are made up of five players including the goaltender, as opposed to six in real life. Players wear ice skates, which are used to skate across the icy arena. Each game is made up of three periods, with the victory going to the team who has the most points at the end of the game. At the beginning, two opposing players from each team face off in the middle of the rink. There are three kinds of players - the first is fast, weak, and feeble, but is good at the face-off; the second is average in all qualities, and the third is slow and poor at the face-off, but very powerful, both in body checking and shooting strength. The arena is similarly designed to a real-world ice hockey arena. The arena is coated in ice, with a goal on either side of the arena. There are a variety of marked areas, including the goal line that the puck must cross to score, the attacking / defending zone which is situated closely to each goal, the face-off spot, the neutral spot, and others. Each side of the arena has exactly the same design. If two opposing players fight for the puck for a certain amount of time, other players join into the fight, resulting in the player from the losing team in the fight to be put in the penalty box for a period of time.",

Choose a country for you and your opponent, select a level of play and face off at center ice to become the top goal scorer in Nintendo\u0027s Ice Hockey! Get charged with a penalty and test your defense. Or attack on a power play and use your puck handling skills to catch your opponents off guard.",

Only professor Elvin, the insane computer expert could crack the top secret start code, Elvin, who entrenches himself in his intangible subterraneous, guarded by 90 murderous robots, that until now had hunted down every intruder. No one who has ever set foot on the lift to Elvins cave labyrinth has returned back alive. \n \nThe last hope: Special Agent 4125, the most cunning, toughest and most indiscriminate man, that the secret service can offer. Only ice cold reckoning and superior physical condition give this unarmed hero a tiny chance to avert the disaster in the last minute. \n \nThe game: your task is to put a stop to evil Elvin Atombender\u0027s game. For this you have to enter in his laboratory, protected by a vault somewhere on his underground stronghold. To open the laboratory\u0027s door you need a nine letters password, each letter of which Elvin coded into a punchcard, just for cutting in four each one of them, painting them in different colors and hiding the resulting pieces everywhere in his base\u0027s furniture. So all you have to do is search into every object of every room for pieces of puzzle while surviving the robots, the pits and doctor Elvin\u0027s annoying voice, retrieve all the 36 pieces, put them together in groups of four, and head for the laboratory, where an unpleasant surprise waits you",

    "storyline": "The player, as Kid Chameleon, progresses through a series of levels, containing an array of deadly enemies and obstacles. Most levels contain a flag, which is the primary goal of each level, from which the player progresses to the next level. However, a number of teleporters throughout the game can warp the player not only to different places in the same level, but also to different levels, and sometimes to an entirely different path through the game. At the end of the game, Kid fights and defeats the final boss, Heady Metal. Kid Chameleon contains 103 levels, of which only about half are on the \"main path\" (traversing levels only by flags), and also counts 32 smaller unnamed levels, simply called \"Elsewhere\". Despite the game\u0027s considerable length, there was no password system or other method of saving the game (although re-releases in compilations and Virtual Console include their own save features). There are several bonuses that can be earned at the end of certain levels (in which the flag is touched), including beating a time limit, not getting hit and not collecting any prizes. \n \nAs Kid Chameleon moves through the game\u0027s levels, he gains access to masks that transform him into different characters. Each character has different special abilities and varying amounts of hit points. Collecting a mask that the player is already wearing will restore its health. The sheer amount of variety in gameplay due to the various characters is part of what gave Kid Chameleon such an addictive style; few levels repeated the same structure and they usually had specific strategies and characters to be beaten. In addition to the offensive abilities of each form, the Kid could also defeat enemies by jumping on them, although he may take damage from some enemies by doing so. Each form can also make use of Diamond Powers which require diamonds collected in the game to use, accessed by pressing A + Start. Players lose a life if Kid Chameleon loses all his hit points in human form, is crushed, falls into bottomless pits or lava or touches the drill wall which appears in certain levels, or if time runs out. Extra lives and continues can be found in the game, with additional lives awarded for every 50,000 points.",
    "summary": "Kid Chameleon is a 1992 platform game released for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. The premise of the game is that the main character, Casey, can use masks to change into different characters in order to use different abilities. It was later released in Japan as Chameleon Kid (カメレオン キッド Kamereon Kiddo?). \n \nThe game is also a part of the Sega Genesis Collection for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. It was released for the Virtual Console in Japan on May 22, 2007; North America on May 28, 2007; and Europe on June 1, 2007. It was also released in addition to a series of other Sega games, including Shining Force and Comix Zone, in Sega Smash Pack 2.

The backstory of Kid Icarus is described in the instruction booklet: before the events of the game, Earth was ruled by Palutena: Goddess of Light and Medusa: Goddess of Darkness. Palutena bestowed the people with light to make them happy. Medusa hated the humans, dried up their crop, and turned them to stone. Enraged by this, Palutena transformed Medusa into a monster and banished her to the Underworld. Out of revenge, Medusa conspired with the monsters of the Underworld to take over Palutena\u0027s residence the Palace in the Sky. She launched a surprise attack, and stole the three sacred treasures — the Mirror Shield, the Light Arrows and the Wings of Pegasus — which deprived Palutena\u0027s army of its power. After her soldiers had been turned to stone by Medusa, Palutena was defeated in battle and imprisoned deep inside the Palace in the Sky.\n\nWith her last power, she sent a bow and arrow to the young angel Pit. He escapes from his prison in the Underworld and sets out to save Palutena and Angel Land. Throughout the course of the story, Pit retrieves the three sacred treasures from the fortress gatekeepers at their respective fortresses in the Underworld, the Overworld, and the Skyworld. Afterward, he equips himself with the treasures and storms the sky temple where he defeats Medusa and rescues Palutena. The game has five different endings; depending on the player\u0027s performance, Palutena may present Pit with headgear or transform him into a full-grown angel.",

Yin-Yarn, the evil sorceror who possessed the tomato (revealed to be a Metamato), appears and magically banishes Kirby into Patch Land, a world completely made of fabric, via the sock carried around his neck. In Patch Land, Kirby\u0027s body transforms into yarn, rendering his power to inhale useless. Instead, Kirby is granted the ability to transform by the magic of the Metamato, which he uses to rescue a boy being attacked by a monster. The boy, named Prince Fluff, explains that Yin-Yarn has separated Patch Land into pieces, which was tied together by magic yarn. Kirby decides to help Prince Fluff collect all seven pieces of the yarn and restore Patch Land.\n\nMeanwhile, Yin-Yarn captures King Dedede and Meta Knight and places them under his control. Kirby is forced to fight Dedede and Meta Knight after they ambush him in Patch Land. When Kirby and Prince Fluff finally collect all the Magic Yarn, Meta Knight, no longer under the sorceror\u0027s influence, informs Kirby that Yin-Yarn is turning Dream Land into fabric. Prince Fluff produces the second sock, its magic fully restored, and uses it to transport Kirby and himself to Dream Land; now completely made of yarn. Kirby confronts and defeats Yin-Yarn, breaking the spell and returning Dream Land and himself back to normal. Prince Fluff parts with Kirby, stating that he can visit Patch Land anytime via Yin-Yarn\u0027s magic sock.",

    "storyline": "A translation of the story officially given by SNK is as follows: \n \n\"Two worlds once existed since ancient times... The world of the living, Ushyo, and the land of the dead, Tokoyo. A legendary boundary to forever separate them, The Hell\u0027s Gate, has existed since the birth of myths to keep an universal balance. There is said to be four gods that defend it: Seiryu of the East, Byakko of the West, Genbu of the North, and Suzaku of the South. They eternally perform their duty from the shadows of legend and were eventually forgotten by people as time passed. \n \nNow, it is the \u0027Bakumatsu\u0027. \n \nThe Tokugawa shogunate, after 200 years of reign, began to have samurai who long dulled their battle skills during the outskirts of the Heian period. People, who have long since grown used to peace, are met with fascinating foreigners and wonder about the confines of their isolation. To add to the confusion, a sudden disturbance occurs. \n \nA natural disaster unprecedented in Japan\u0027s history began. It was rumored to be the Majin Revival, a time when gods were to walk the land once more and deliver divine punishment. In a land where no chaos was said to exist, the people could do nothing but watch and despair. \n \nHowever, it was said that there are individuals who did not. People who haven\u0027t lost their fighting spirit and stood to face the chaos. Those who wanted to find the real cause behind the disturbance and stop it. Moreover, people who were unexpectedly born at the center of chaos. Those who had the ambitions to control the threat and those who are said to be the cause of the Majin Revival. Without speculation of their cause, they are brought together by a heavy fate as their battle begins.\" \n \nThe passage to the land of the dead, Hell\u0027s Gate, which was previously guarded by Four Sacred Beasts appears to be opened. However, chaos sweeps the land once the gods are encased in human flesh, otherwise known as the Majin Revival. The story of the series continues to focus on how certain individuals choose to confront such conflict, and depicts how each of them are drawn on the same string of fate.",

One day, while playing alone in his bedroom, he was rudely interrupted by a family of dirty rats. Chasing them out of his room, the little boy suddenly found himself lost in a vast, mysterious forest, where he happened upon a magical crown that imbued him with the power to command. The little boy -- with his newfound companions Liam, Verde, and Howser the Bull Knight at his side -- has (rather surprisingly) become the leader of the small, down-on-its-luck kingdom of Alpoko.\n\nWith his newfound powers of persuasion, the little boy began working to raise Alpoko from the depths of obscurity and poverty into the dizzying heights of absolute power and prosperity. With Howser offering effective advice and unrestrained ambition, and the citizens of Alpoko sharing his grandiose plans (whether they want to or not), the little boy marches ever onward to his ultimate goal of World Domination!\"",
    "summary": "\"Initially released for Wii to rave reviews, this cult classic real-time strategy game juxtaposes cutesy fairytale visuals with some decidedly adult cynicism for a zany, irreverent adventure to build, enhance, and maintain a mystical, magical kingdom.

Can you keep Alpoko safe from the Onii and help our little hero become king of the whole world?\"",

This version introduces some new tricks, updates some features, and brings depth to some game modes from previous Madden titles.\n\nThe 07 game focuses on the Running Back by giving you lead blocker controls. After selecting a running play, you can cycle through offensive players to open up gaps. New evasive maneuvers are controlled with a separate stick to elude defenders, along with new juking and spinning maneuvers.\n\nStart a career with your favorite NFL team, draft the players, call the plays, and lead your team to a dynasty. Or, make your own player and guide him on and off the field through his entire career starting with the draft. If you do not want to mess with all the options and features you can simply sit down for a quick game.",

    "summary": "Magical Drop is played in a style and gameplay similar to Compile\u0027s (now Sega\u0027s) Puyo Puyo and Taito\u0027s Puzzle Bobble franchises; a \"stack\" of random colored bubbles descend from the top, and a player is defeated when a bubble hits the bottom. Bubbles can be picked up and dropped by the player\u0027s \"clown\" at the bottom, and are destroyed when three or more of the same color are put together on a single column. \"Chains\" are formed either when a single drop caused a chain reaction, or when more than one group of bubbles is destroyed in quick succession. The game is normally played with two players (one may be a computer opponent), and chains cause the opponent\u0027s stack to descend faster.\n\nThere are 24 characters, all but the Black Pierrot being named after a tarot card (although the Strength card has been represented by two characters throughout the series). Different characters have different attack patterns. The columns of the opponent\u0027s stack will descend at different rates relative to each other depending on the character chosen. This causes a disjunction of colors that may make it more difficult for the other player to clear their stack. For example, with the character Devil, all the columns will descend at the same rate, whereas with Sun, the middle columns will descend faster than the others.",

    "summary": "Mario Kart Wii is a multiplayer-oriented racing game for the Wii, and the sixth main installment in the Mario Kart series. Mario Kart Wii retains the traditional item-based weaponry familiar with the franchise, where players can select a Mario franchise driver and themed vehicles. As with most racing games, the overarching goal is to place first among other competitors, through the usage of such items and taking the fastest routes to secure the leads. Several new key elements introduced to Mario Kart Wii include increasing the number of racers to 12 racers from 8 racers from previous entries in the series, as well as introducing a new type of vehicle to the franchise: bikes. The game takes advantage of features unique to the Wii, most notably its motion control capabilities. A Wii Wheel is included in most Mario Kart Wii packages, though the game is still compatible with other controllers. Game modes are also present such as the traditional Grand Prix, Versus, Battle, and Time Trial modes.",

In addition, players now travel across stages together in a vehicle towards a common goal - overcoming obstacles, battling bosses, and collecting Mini Stars stolen by Bowser™ and his minions. Featuring 80 new minigames, adventurous new stages, and all-new ways to play that blend cooperative and competitive action for up to four players*, Mario Party 9 is the perfect way to get the party started.\n\n-For the first time in the Mario Party franchise, each stage culminates in a Boss Battle. Collectively, players must combine their strength to defeat classic foes such as Bowser™ and King Boo while still playing competitively to boost their own individual scores.\n\n-In another first for the series, players ride across stages together in special vehicles. Players take turns as Captain of the vehicle by hitting Dice Blocks to move the party forward, hoping to land on lucky spaces. The vehicles also help to streamline game play and keep everyone involved in the action.\n\n-Unique Captain Events on each stage give players a new way to change the shape of the game.\n\n-In Mario Party 9, each themed stage has a clear destination point but with multiple paths along the way, so no two games will play the same. From Toad Road to Boo’s Horror Castle, players will encounter a wide variety of familiar Mario franchise elements in new environments that can be enjoyed solo or with friends.\n\n-Includes 80 outrageous new minigames that find players making pizzas, escaping haunted mansions, and racing snowmobiles.\n\n-No time to play through an entire stage? New minigame modes let players enjoy the action in smaller chunks of time. They can hone their skills at any minigame in Free Play mode or try the Extras mode that includes Goomba Bowling and the puzzle-based Castle Clearout.\n\n-Every time they play, players can earn Party Points that are used to unlock special items and features.\n\n* Additional accessories are required for multiplayer game play and are sold separately.",

Mega Man saves Wily from crashing and Wily says that Roboenza-infected robots attacked his spaceship and stole the parts to a medicine-making machine he had been working on to cure the virus. Mega Man agrees to retrieve the stolen parts from the eight Robot Masters. Before he begins, Proto Man arrives to help Mega Man, believing the job to be too big for just one of them and the two join forces to acquire the cure. \n \nAfter taking down four Robot Masters, Dr. Wily presents what he claims is a prototype cure for Roll and asks if Mega Man is feeling Roboenza symptoms, to which Mega Man says he\u0027s feeling fine. After the last one is defeated, Mega Man comes down with Roboenza and is nearly incapacitated as Dr. Wily reveals that it was him behind the disease and that all robots who want the cure must serve under him.

Since Dr. Wily\u0027s last defeat, the Blue Bomber has seen peace return. \n \nJust when people forgot all about Dr. Wily, robots all over the world began going crazy. It soon became apparent that these robots were those created by Dr. Light. As phone calls came pouring into Light\u0027s lab, Dr. Wily interrupted all television programs to announce that these robotic riots were not his doing. He then continued to show video evidence that proved Dr. Light\u0027s involvement in the recent violent outbreaks. To make matters worse, Wily gave the account number to his personal bank account and announced that he would accept donations to build his own robot army to counter that of Light\u0027s. Mega Man quickly volunteered to clear Light\u0027s name and was sent out to investigate the source of the problem. \n \nBefore long, the police came to Light Labs to arrest the good doctor, but Light went along quietly to prove his innocence. Meanwhile, Mega Man went after the Robot Masters and, after he defeated a few of them, discovered that they were scheduled to be decommissioned and sent to the junkyard because they had reached the expiration date assigned to them by the government. Once the final Robot Master had been taken down, Mega Man brought back one of the robot\u0027s internal memory units to Auto for investigation. As it turned out, Dr. Wily had reprogrammed the robots, who were scheduled for demolition, to rise up against their human masters rather than be destroyed. All the robots wanted to do was have a purpose, and they certainly did not want to be sent to the scrap heap. \n \nAfter they had viewed the video, Dr. Wily burst into their lab and stole the memory circuit and then withdrew to his newly constructed Wily Castle. Mega Man made his way through the fortress, fighting powerful robots built with the money Wily received from donations from those concerned with the robot uprisings. In the end, Mega Man defeated Wily once again, and showed him footage of every single defeat he had dealt Wily. Although Wily seemed contrite and apologetic, he tricked Mega Man into thinking that Dr. Light was, in fact, imprisoned in a jail cell in the next room. Although Proto Man warned him that it was a trap, Mega Man went to investigate the cell and was electrocuted by the Dr. Light decoy that was in the cell instead. As Wily\u0027s lab self-destructed, Proto Man returned and teleported Mega Man out of the lab just in time. \n \nIn the end, Light was released from prison. He then found useful purposes for all of the Robot Masters he had designed, which had reached their expiration dates. \n \nAlthough the ending states that Dr. Wily was nowhere to be found after the destruction of his base, the credits show Concrete Man chasing him.",

    "storyline": "Near the end of the 20th century, the West discovers that a weapon of mass destruction is being constructed inside Outer Heaven, a fortified state founded by a \"legendary mercenary\" 200 km north of Galzburg, South Africa. The special forces unit FOXHOUND sends top agent Gray Fox to infiltrate the fortress, assess the situation and neutralize the threat. FOXHOUND loses contact with Gray Fox a few days later, with his last transmission being \"METAL GEAR...\" To discover what happened to Gray Fox, FOXHOUND commander Big Boss sends his newest recruit, Solid Snake, into the area in an operation codenamed Intrude N313.\n\nUpon insertion into Outer Heaven, Snake makes contact with local resistance members Schneider, Diane, and Jennifer. Using all of his skills and the equipment he procures on site, he manages to rescue Fox. Fox explains that Metal Gear is the codename of a nuclear-equipped bipedal walking tank, which can engage in all forms of combat and launch nuclear weapons from any location. Outer Heaven plans to use Metal Gear to impose itself as the new world superpower.\n\nTo destroy Metal Gear and topple the Outer Heaven mercenaries, Snake rescues lead Metal Gear engineer Dr. Pettrovich Madnar and his daughter Ellen. The scientist explains how Metal Gear can be destroyed, and Snake takes on Outer Heaven\u0027s troops. However, he begins to notice that traps put in his way are too precise, and wonders how information on his activities are being tracked. Big Boss begins to act strangely and eventually tells Snake to abort the mission (breaking the fourth wall by telling the player to turn off the console). Moreover, Schneider is ambushed by hostiles and is presumed dead after losing contact with Snake.\n\nSnake penetrates Outer Heaven\u0027s main base and takes out Metal Gear before it reaches completion. As he safely escapes the compound\u0027s basement, he is confronted by the mercenary leader of Outer Heaven, who turns out to be Big Boss. The corrupt leader reveals that he had been using his connections to steal military intelligence, establish his own mercenary force, and fund his activities. It was his aim to have Outer Heaven become the world\u0027s greatest superpower, able to bring even the West to its knees. He had the rookie Snake sent in, hoping to have him captured and feed misinformation to authorities, but had quite obviously underestimated Snake\u0027s capabilities.\n\nHaving lost Metal Gear and much of his force, Big Boss seemingly starts the self-destruct sequence for the compound, and promises he will not die alone; Snake will join him. Snake defeats Big Boss in a last battle and escapes the Outer Heaven compound as it crumbles in flames behind him. After the end credits, a message from Big Boss is displayed saying that he will meet Solid Snake again.",
    "summary": "Metal Gear is considered to be the progenitor of the stealth game genre, it was also the first video game designed by Hideo Kojima, who also directed many of the later Metal Gear sequels. A heavily altered port was produced for the Famicom/NES (without Kojima\u0027s involvement). A remade version based on the original MSX2 game was released as a bonus game in Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence for the PlayStation 2 and, as a result, is also included in Metal Gear Solid HD Collection and Metal Gear Solid: The Legacy Collection.\n\nThe game revolves around a special forces operative codenamed Solid Snake who goes into a solo infiltration mission into the fortified state of Outer Heaven to destroy Metal Gear, a bipedal walking tank capable of launching nuclear missiles from anywhere in the world.\n\nThe player must navigate the main character, a military operative codenamed Solid Snake, through various locations, while avoiding visual contact and direct confrontation with patrolling guards. If the player is seen, the game enters the \"Alert Mode.\" In this situation, Snake must escape from enemy\u0027s sight in order to resume infiltration. The method of escaping varies depending on the circumstances behind discovery:\n\nIf Snake is seen and only a single exclamation mark appears over an enemy\u0027s head, only the enemies in the player\u0027s present screen will attack and Snake can escape by simply moving to an adjacent screen.\nHowever, if two exclamation marks appear over the enemy (or the player triggers an alarm by being spotted by a camera, infrared sensor or by using an unsuppressed weapon), reinforcements from off-screen will appear as well. Snake can only escape by eliminating all incoming enemies, going outdoors, or by entering an elevator.\nThe player starts the game unarmed, but eventually acquires firearms such as a Beretta 92F and an M79 grenade launcher, as well as explosives such as remote control missiles and landmines. Ammo and supplies for weapons are limited, but are replenished by picking up ammunition caches or additional supplies. Weapons can not only be used to kill enemies, but also to clear obstacles such as hollow walls and electrified floors. Snake can also use his fists to punch and defeat patrolling enemies. Occasionally, if the player defeats a guard with punches without alerting anyone, the defeated guard will yield a single unit of rations or an ammo box that can be picked up. In addition to enemy guards, the player will also be confronted by mercenaries who will challenge the player to combat, serving as the boss characters.\n\nThe enemy base consists of three different buildings, with multiple floors (including basement levels) within them. The player uses key cards and other items to unlock doors and explore new areas. Each door will only open to its corresponding key cards. Information can be obtained by rescuing hostages being held within the buildings. After rescuing five hostages, the player\u0027s rank will increase by one star (with the maximum rank being four stars), allowing for increased carrying capacity and maximum health. However, if a hostage is killed, the player is demoted to the previous rank.\n\nA transceiver is available for the player to communicate with their commanding officer, Big Boss, or one of the resistance members operating covertly near Outer Heaven (Schneider, Diane, and Jennifer). Each of Snake\u0027s allies specializes in a specific subject. The player must keep track of their allies\u0027 frequency numbers in order to contact them. All of the radio messages are dependent on the rooms where the player is located.",

    "summary": "A part of the Metroid series, it features gameplay in both first- and third-person perspectives, and is the first installment of the franchise to feature melee attacks which could only be executed when an enemy\u0027s health was reduced to a certain degree.\nThe game gave significant focus on plot and characterization, with extensive usage of cinematics and voice acting.\n\nThe regular gameplay features a third person perspective, where players hold the Wii Remote horizontally. Samus can jump, fire the arm cannon, and turn into a morph ball, which can roll into narrow passages and drop energy bombs. While gameplay is similar to early Metroid titles, the game\u0027s environments are three-dimensional and movement is not limited to a two-dimensional plane. Other M is the first in the series to feature a melee combat system. With well-timed button presses, players can use special techniques such as the Sense Move, which allows them to dodge enemy attacks, and the Overblast, where Samus jumps on the enemy and fires a charged shot at point-blank range.\n\nWhen the Wii Remote is pointed towards the screen, the angle switches to a first-person view, where players can lock onto targets and fire missiles; however, players cannot move in this perspective. There are several instances where players will have to constantly switch between play modes; for example, fighting off a horde of flying enemies in third person, while switching to first person to destroy their spawn points. Additionally, the first-person mode is also used in exploration, such as locating hidden items.",

But this culture is threatened; Tokugawa\u0027s thirst for power leads to a conflict over the enormously powerful, though cursed, Demon Blades. Used in hatred, drenched in blood, the cursed blades condemn those who use them to tragedy, madness, and untimely deaths. As chaos spreads, denizens from the netherworld breach their realm as these malevolent swords summon evil spirits -- and the Dragon and Demon Gods as well. \nFeaturing hand-drawn 2D art reflecting the heritage and tone of the storyline, Muramasa: The Demon Blade transports players into a little known mythology, envisioned by the creators of the critically acclaimed Odin Sphere. Players take on the role of a male ninja or female kunoichi, utilizing their ninja prowess to traverse the clever side-scrolling levels that feature vertical progression as well as the traditional horizontal stage advancement.",

You need to jump over, kick, and run from various enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges at the right moment.\n\nThe game was considered revolutionary in its time for its graphic technique. As the main character walked around the outside of the tower, the character was fixed in the middle of the screen while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a pseudo-3D effect.\n\nTowers are linked together via a voyage through the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays out as a side-scrolling collect-\u0027em-up in which bonus points can be obtained.",

Players choose from two game modes, stroke play for one or two players, and match play for two players only. \n \nCompeting on one of four fictional golf courses located in the United States, Japan, Australia and Germany, players choose from one of six players with different attributes: \n \n \"Young Hero\" (George Spinner, USA) \n \"Technician\" (Thomas Stewart, United Kingdom) \n \"Veteran\" (Frank Adams, Australia) \n \"Shot Maker\" (Robert Landolt, Germany) \n \"Power Golfer\" (Fernando Almeida, Brazil) \n \"Putt Master\" (Toyoshige Takeno, Japan) \n \nUnlike many golf games of the era which used a two-click swing system to determine the hook or slice of the ball, Neo Turf Masters uses a single click for the power of the shot, and a second for the height of the shot; hook and slice are selected with buttons B and C before making the shot. This makes the game much easier to pick up and play well than its contemporaries, but it compensates for this reduced difficulty with fiendish (if somewhat unrealistic) course layouts and highly variable wind.",

But then one day, the legendary monster Orochi, came back to life and put an evil curse on the entire area. Everything that had a bit of life, disappeared from the face of the earth, and in their place was left a dreadful, barren wasteland.\n\nOrochi\u0027s horrid curse spread all across the land, turning it into a veritable hell on earth, infested with countless monsters roaming the earth. But there was one hope. The majestic, wolf-embodied sun god Amaterasu.\n\nOne-hundred years ago, Amaterasu used the godly power of the Celestial Brush, to face Orochi. But their battle consumed them both, causing them to disappear from the world, with Amaterasu losing the thirteen Celestial Brush powers in the process.\n\nNow in the present, Amaterasu stumbles upon a mysterious fairy sprite named Issun, and together they set out on an adventure, as Amaterasu aims to regain the 13 powers of the Celestial brush and defeat Orochi once and for all.",
    "summary": "Set sometime in classical Japanese history, Ōkami combines several Japanese mythology and folklore to tell the story of how the land was saved from darkness by the Shinto sun goddess named Amaterasu, who took the form of a white wolf with celestial markings covering its fur. It features a distinct sumi-e-inspired cel-shaded visual style and the Celestial Brush, a gesture-system used to perform miracles.",

The player controls Pac-Man through a maze, eating pac-dots (also called pellets or just dots). When all pac-dots are eaten, Pac-Man is taken to the next stage. Four enemies (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde) roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man. If an enemy touches Pac-Man, a life is lost and the Pac-Man itself withers and dies. When all lives have been lost, the game ends. Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as power pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the enemies. The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next, generally becoming shorter as the game progresses.",

As if that weren\u0027t enough, they cast an evil spell on the fairies who were best friends with each other, causing them to fight with each other! \"At this rate, those monsters will take over the entire fairy world!\" One fairy alone--Lip, who managed to escape from the monsters\u0027 magic--went to rescue her fellow fairies.",

    "storyline": "Somewhere deep within the Andromeda Galaxy lies the Algol Star System. The parent star, Algol (referred to as \"Algo\" by this point in the timeline), has three planets orbiting about it. First is Palm (\"Palma\"), the home of the government. Governors, treasurers, and great thinkers dwell here in great ivory towers, away from the hubbub of everyday life. Next is Mota (\"Motavia\"), the shining jewel. Once a dry desert planet infested with ant lions, Mota has been transformed into a blue and green tropical paradise. Domed farms grow crops, and the water is regulated into dammed rivers. Life on Mota is sweet, peaceful, and easy. The people have everything they want and do not need to work. Farthest out is Dezo (\"Dezoris\"), the ice planet. Little is known about this mysterious and dark planet.\n\nOne thousand years have passed since Alis and her friends liberated Algo from the evil Lassic. Algo has since prospered under the care of a giant computer called the Mother Brain. The Mother Brain regulates the climatrol tower, the bio-systems lab, and all other things that provide whatever the people in Mota need.\n\nThe game begins with the character Rolf recalling a strange recurring nightmare he has been having. In the dream, a young girl who Rolf does not recognize (but who resembles Alis) is battling a demon. Finally, just before the demon would kill her, Rolf awakens. From his home in Paseo, Mota\u0027s capital, Rolf goes to the central tower to meet with the commander, the head of government on Mota, in order to receive his newest mission.\n\nThe first threat is an increase in dangerous biomonsters (biologically altered animals). Rolf sets off with his companion Nei, a humanoid with cat-like features, to investigate, accompanied by six others with each different, but same purpose. Along the way, the group discovers a human-biomonster hybrid named Neifirst, who reveals that Nei\u0027s origins are the same as her own. Being part biomonster, she is an outcast from society, causing her to loathe mankind and, because of this, sabotage both Mota\u0027s climate control system and the biosystems laboratory. Nei confronts Neifirst and battles her in a one-on-one fight, but is defeated and killed. Anguished, Rolf and the remaining party defeat Neifirst, bringing an end to Mota\u0027s Biomonster hazard.\n\nHowever, this sets another incident in motion: the exploding impact causes the central lake, the residential reservoir of Mota, to overflow with water. To prevent a massive flood, Rolf and his friends decide to open up the surrounding four dams. After unlocking the last one, they are captured by Mother Brain\u0027s security robots and sentenced to death upon the Gaira satellite. However, the satellite malfunctions and collides with Palm, destroying both. Rolf and company are rescued in the nick of time by a space pirate, Tyler.\n\nThe group boards Mota\u0027s last plane to Dezo. Located at a far corner of the planet is the Esper Mansion. Upon reaching there, Rolf awakens the legendary Lutz from a long sleep. Lutz reveals the secrets of Rolf\u0027s past, as well as the dark secret of Mother Brain which relates to the fate and destruction Algo is now facing. In order to save the system, the heroes seek to recover the powerful Nei arsenal, found in four hidden dungeons, capable against the enemies on the spaceship Noah, where Mother Brain resides.\n\nIt is eventually revealed that Dark Force has been behind every threat Rolf has faced, including Mother Brain itself. Rolf confronts the two evil entities and defeats them. After the final battle, Lutz alerts him that there are still people on the ship: the remaining survivors from Earth. They reveal they created Mother Brain to satisfy their greedy lifestyle at the expense of Algo\u0027s resources, and a fight between the heroes and the earthmen ensues. The game ends there on an open-ended note, with the outcome of the fight left unrevealed.",

The player must defeat enemies in the overworld and in dungeons to advance in the game.\n\nThe game abandoned the first-person view that the first game used for dungeons and battles. Phantasy Star II instead uses a top-down perspective for exploration and a third-person view in battles.",

The reasons behind the malfunctions are clarified as the plot unfolds, relating directly to the events of Phantasy Star II.\n\nChaz and his allies connect the world\u0027s troubles to a cult leader called Zio, \"The Black Magician,\" whose aims appear to be total annihilation, not only of Motavia, but of the whole Algol solar system. The heroes stop Zio in order to restore the computer systems maintaining Motavia. However, it soon becomes clear that Zio is merely the vanguard to a much larger enemy, long buried in the past.

Marona has the ability to communicate with phantoms, an ability that brings a lot of resentment from other people but will help her to head out into the world and solve the problems that are occurring. A phantom known as Ash acts as Marona\u0027s guardian; as the game progresses, other phantoms will join your party, each of which have different capabilities.\n\nThe game features a turn based combat system. During battles, Marona is able to attack enemies by herself, and she can also summon phantoms in her party to help out. To summon phantoms, you will need to confine them to an object on the screen (such as a rock or tree). Once confined to an object, you will then be able to control the phantom in battle, though phantoms only remain controllable for a limited number of turns. The object you confine a phantom to will affect it\u0027s abilities; for example, a rock may make a phantom stronger but move slower. By defeating enemies in battle you earn experience points allowing to level up and become more powerful.",

    "storyline": "The first case of the game presents defense attorney Phoenix Wright at his first trial under Mia Fey\u0027s watchful eye, successfully defending his childhood friend Larry Butz for murder. However, in the game\u0027s second case, Mia is murdered for being aware of corporate blackmail, and her younger sister Maya Fey is charged with the crime because her name was found on a piece of evidence. While defending her, Phoenix is reintroduced to another childhood friend, Miles Edgeworth, who is the prosecutor for Maya\u0027s case and has established himself as a \"genius\" for the prosecution system. Maya is found not guilty of the crime, and becomes Phoenix\u0027s assistant in further cases, offering her channeling ability as a \"Spirit Medium\" of Kurain village to bring the spirit of Mia to help at critical times. Phoenix and Edgeworth find that while they have their friendship from their youth, they continue to face off against each other in the courtroom. In the third case, Phoenix and Maya investigate the murder of a famous actor.In the fourth case, Edgeworth is charged with murder, and Phoenix steps up to defend him. It is discovered that Edgeworth was set up by his old mentor, Manfred von Karma. Several years earlier, Manfred shot and killed Edgeworth\u0027s father, a defense attorney, after he ruined Manfred\u0027s perfect record, but led Edgeworth to believe he shot his own father. Phoenix is able to expose Manfred\u0027s cover-up and achieve a \"not guilty\" verdict for Edgeworth. After the case, Edgeworth thinks about taking time off from his position to consider the events, while Maya announces she is going back to her home in Kurain Village to train.\nThe fifth case, added for the Nintendo DS, iOS, and Wii versions, has Ema Skye begging Wright for help to defend her older sister Lana, who is on trial for murder, compounded by a second murder of the same apparent victim in a different building at the same time. Using Ema\u0027s scientific help to establish evidence and the surprising prosecution help of Edgeworth during the trial, Phoenix is able to learn that Lana Skye was blackmailed by the Chief of Police Damon Gant into covering for a murder she thought that Ema had committed several years before. Gant himself is revealed to have committed the murder and pinned the blame on Ema. Though Lana is cleared of murder charges, she willingly goes to jail for being an accomplice; Ema says her goodbyes as she heads to Europe to study forensic science.",

    "summary": "Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney − Trials and Tribulations (known as Gyakuten Saiaban 3 in Japan) is the third game in the Ace Attorney series. Players take on the role of Phoenix Wright, a defense attorney known for taking on seemingly impossible cases. While the game focuses on a few specific cases, the overarching story of the Phoenix Wright franchise spans the length of the series, involving obscure characters from large families and intricate webs of lies, plots, and murder. The nature of the series remains generally lighthearted, something that\u0027s reinforced by its playful, anime-inspired visual style, but the nature of the crimes committed can be cold and downright disturbing. While the game\u0027s legal acumen is highly dubious, its aim seems to be more about producing comedic or stereotypically dramatic courtroom moments. Ace Attorney 3 makes light use of the DS touch screen, allowing the player to examine crime scenes and inspect evidence and character profiles. The top screen is used more for storytelling purposes, displaying various dialogue and conversations between characters. During these sequences the lower screen becomes a selection menu, displaying a series of questions to ask witnesses and further your investigation in search of evidence to use in defense of your client in each chapter.",

Before the game was released it was revealed that creator Shingo Takatsuka had given the game a complete overhaul following the serious criticism of the previous title.\n\n\nOne of the first screenshots of PES 2009 displaying the improved graphics\nThe game supports network play with a reduction in lag compared to PES 2008 although there are still many criticisms as it is far from lag-free. Lionel Messi is featured as the cover although Andres Guardado features on some versions. A new game mode called Become A Legend has been brought in which involves creating a player and taking him through a career. The Master League mode now has two-tier negotiations which involve negotiating with the club first and then the player separately. Also the edit mode was notably improved with badges and kits now being as intuitive as they were on PS2 versions.\n\nAlthough the game is generally viewed as an improvement, the Online Mode and the omission of players such as Danny Alves, Tomas Zapotocny and Walter Lopez drew plenty of criticism.\n\nThe game will be followed by PES 2010.",

For what reason, sir?\"\n\n\"None of these scrolls will have any of the secrets I need. It\u0027s enough to be considered the strongest for obtaining these legendary scrolls. That\u0027s all. As long as I know that I am the first person to have collected these in its 2,000 years of history, I will never have a use for these.\"\n\n\"But still, even if you do not dispose them...\"\n\n\"These scrolls have a different meaning with those Jin brothers. I don\u0027t want to understand what they\u0027re capable of in their hands.\"\n\n\"...Even the newly revived Geese has something that he fears then...\"\n\n\"Do not misunderstand me. Even the Geese Howard resurrected from darkness doesn\u0027t want to repeat the same mistakes...Like with those foolish Bogards...\"\n\nBilly Kane was petrified and could not bring himself to speak against the flames of dark hatred that burned within Geese. Geese shuts his eyes deeply and moves to glance outside the window.\n\n\"Billy, how is the city\u0027s current reaction?\"\n\n\"Sir, they are frightened by your apparent defeat,\" Billy managed to answer.\n\n\"Is King of Fighters\u0027 arrangements all in order?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Kim Kapwhan, Duck King, and all of the other recipients seemed to have responded positively.\"\n\n\"Hehe...that last tournament didn\u0027t profit me at all. It\u0027s time to remind them that Geese Howard is this town\u0027s only ruler.\"\n\nIts long silence broken, Geese Tower\u0027s lights kick alive. When the wolf\u0027s fangs thirst for blood, a shiver can be felt throughout the town.\n\nAfter stealing the Jin Scrolls of Immortality, Geese Howard takes control of South Town once again.

    "summary": "Real Bout changes the play controls from the previous Fatal Fury games, reducing the number of attack buttons from four to three: a standard Punch and Kick button, a \"Strong Attack\" button which can be either a stronger punch or kick attack, depending on the character. The game retains the three-plane \"oversway\" system from Fatal Fury 3, which features a main lane for fighting, with foreground and background planes used to avoid attacks or leap towards the opponent. A dedicated button is now used to make an \"oversway\" (or change plane) towards the background or foreground.\n\nReal Bout introduces a Power Gauge, which fills up as the player performs normal or special techniques against their opponent or defend themselves, similar to many super move gauges featured in other fighting games. The Power Gauge allows players to perform one of three types of Special Techniques, depending of the level of the Power Gauge.\n\nReal Bout also introduces stages with ring-outs, a gameplay feature previously introduced in 3D fighting games such as Virtua Fighter. If the player performs certain attacks on their opponent while next to the boundaries, the character will eventually destroy the barrier keeping the opponent in the ring and be able to knock them out of the stage for an easy win.",

    "summary": "Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition features the bonus content from the PS2 version and has many alterations compared to previous ports, taking Wiimote aiming into account: the shooting mechanism uses a much larger reticule that turns from green to red when an enemy is targeted as opposed to a very narrow laser sight, a \"quick knife\" command is added that auto-targets the nearest enemy or object, and motion sensitive quick time event prompts are included as well as button presses. \n \nVisually the game is on par with the original GameCube version, as opposed to the somewhat inferior graphics of the PlayStation 2 version, although in very few instances the inferior PS2 graphics are mistakenly retained, such as herbs having lower detail models in some places. The P.R.L. 412 was significantly upgraded and now shoots several beams instead of just one. The Wii version also supports the Wii\u0027s Classic Controller, which reverts aiming and the laser sight back to the original format. The only other noticeable differences are that the game seems significantly easier, and that all of Leon\u0027s actions appear to move slightly faster.",

The game also spawned two sequels in its time, Midnight Run: Road Fighter 2 in 1995 and Winding Heat in 1996, respectively.

The guitar controller, modelled after the Fender Stratocaster, has five additional fret buttons near the neck, for fast fingertapping sessions. There is also an effect switch to toggle between five different effects. Players use the instruments to match notes on the screen, divided in different portions for different instruments, along with the lyrics for the singer who need to match the pitch.",

    "storyline": "The story is set on the planet Nu-Earth, which is caught in the gravitational forces of two suns and a black hole (used by Southers to warp into their space station high command), where a perpetual war between the Norts and Southers is being fought, in which millions have been killed. During the war all forms of chemical and biological weapons have been used, poisoning the planet, and the troops of both sides must live in enclosed cities and only venture into the outside if wearing protective gear known as a \"bio-suit\". The Southers have, through genetic engineering (done by the so-called \"gene genies\"), developed a race of warriors who are immune to the deadly atmosphere and will therefore be superior troops, the Genetic Infantry. All of the G.I.s were made immune to all toxins, diseases, and acids (except for one). The Souther High Command deploy their secret weapon in an airborne assault, but a traitor has betrayed the secret of the G.I.s to the Norts and they are massacred during the drop. This is known as the Quartz Zone Massacre.\n\nRogue, apparently the only surviving G.I. (until he meets Venus Bluegenes), goes AWOL in order to track down the Traitor General responsible and avenge the rest of the G.I.s.

Upon landing the first mission is a tutorial in how to use Rogue’s skills and also the Bio-chips of Gunnar and then Bagman. The third Bio-chip of Helm is received in a later mission. The Bio-chips have their own abilities. Gunnar is stuck to the side of Rogue’s rifle and can be used as a sentry while Rogue flanks the enemy. Bagman provides ammunition and upgrades for Rogue’s equipment made from salvage collected along the way and also looks after his health. Helm is used for accessing computer consoles and panels allowing Rogue access into prohibited areas.\n\nRogue works his way through the various levels as stealthily as is possible trying to take the Norts by surprise with kill moves but with the arsenal at his disposal he is quite capable of also unleashing hell and going toe to toe with the enemy. Tracking the traitor General, Rogue eventually catches up in the final mission with an abundance of Norts trying to stop him.",

    "storyline": "This is the story of the first encounter with the Bydo, taking place in the year 2163. The player controls the R-9A Arrowhead to free humanity from the Bydo threat. \n \nOther versions of the story state that First Contact started after the World Government had sent a probe to Galaxy X1X. Having found the Bydo building their forces, the government prepared the R-9A in advance.",
    "summary": "R-Type is set in the 22nd century, and the player flies a futuristic fighter craft called the R-9a \"Arrowhead\", named for its shape, and because it is the ninth model in the \u0027R\u0027 series of fighter craft (but it is the first of the series to actually be used in combat; the previous models were all prototypes). The mission is to \u0027blast off and strike the evil Bydo Empire\u0027. The R- in the series title originally stood for \"ray\", as in a ray of light. It was a reference to the many different types of ray-like weapons in the first R-Type. his was later retconned in R-Type Final to refer specifically to the production code as well as a term of endearment for the player fighter craft, the \"Round Canopy\". \n \nThe original R-Type was well received by most gaming critics. However, it was also infamous for its relentless difficulty. It earned 7th place in IGN\u0027s Top 10 most difficult games to beat. The gameplay of R-Type is noticeably distinct among shoot \u0027em ups. Invariably the player will lose, not because of an inequality in firepower, but because of the design of the levels themselves. There is usually a \u0027correct\u0027 way to get through a level, but players must learn these by experience - i.e. by losing and restarting from earlier in the level. The game innovated with its weapon system compared to contemporary shooters, featuring a chargeable shot (beam-meter), and detachable \u0027force\u0027 pod; levels were designed to require different tactics and ideal weapons (air-air, diagonal, or air-ground laser).",

An in-depth storyline exists, much like in any other RPG; however, the player\u0027s destiny in the game is not predetermined. Character interaction plays a major role, and your responses to the various characters in the game can ultimately change the story content and even the final outcome. The battle system is divided into two main parts; ground combat and air combat. Ground combat takes place using two-legged mechanized suits, which transform into jet fighters to take the fight to the sky. Every mech unit in the game can transform from battle mech mode to jet fighter mode during combat. Once transformed, weapons and movement methods will change as well. For example, the hero\u0027s ground mode utilizes a sword as his main weapon, but in jet mode he will use long-range missiles.",

It has been re-released via downloading services such as the Wii\u0027s Virtual Console and Steam in 2010. It was also included in the Sega Genesis Collection for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable but it was omitted in PAL version (Sega Mega Drive Collection).\n\nIt is the second game in the Shinobi series released for the Mega Drive, following The Revenge of Shinobi. However, it is not a continuation of the previous game, but rather a loose adaptation to the 1989 arcade game Shadow Dancer. Like in the original arcade game, the player controls a ninja followed by a canine companion. The Secret of Shinobi was well received by critics.",

New to the series are a depiction of Silent Hill\u0027s demonic alter-dimension as a world of ice, and the removal of weapons from the game: when the monsters come out, Harry must literally run for his life. Between scenes, the game will cut to a psychiatrist\u0027s office, who asks personal questions about Harry and his past experiences. The game will then alter itself based on the player\u0027s responses, changing characters and lines of dialog to something intended to be more personally uncomfortable.",

    "storyline": "The game follows protagonist Karl Fairburne as he attempts to prevent the Soviet Union taking control of Germany\u0027s nuclear secrets in and around Berlin, April 1945. Very little information is known about his background, other than he was raised in Berlin as the son of a U.S. ambassador to Germany before the war broke out, that he studied at West Point shortly after America\u0027s entrance into the war, and the fact that he was chosen for this mission because the city was his childhood home.",
    "summary": "Sniper Elite is a third-person action strategy game with a focus on sniping. The player takes on the role of an American agent working for the OSS (the organization that later became the CIA) stationed in Berlin at the end of World War II, tasked with preventing the Russian troops from getting hold of the research Germany had been conducting into nuclear weaponry. As an elite sniper, the style of play is much less run-and-gun and much more about finding good positions, lining up shots and taking out the enemy before he even knows where you are. \n \nThe single-player campaign takes place over 28 missions set in and around Berlin. Players use stealth tactics, and things like wind and background noise can be a factor when lining up shots. When a shot is performed particularly well, players are rewarded with a \u0027bullet cam\u0027 which follows the bullet in slow-motion from gun barrel to target.",

During the game, the camera perspective switches occasionally from third person to side-scrolling. During development, Sega explained that they were delisting sub-standard games in the Sonic series and developing new titles in order to increase the value of the brand. Development included the interchanging perspective, the idea for the game to be set at an amusement park, and a unique music score. Sega revealed that they were developing the game for a wide demographic, which included both older and younger consumers. The game introduces power-ups called Wisps, which the player can use to increase attack power and reach places they cannot otherwise.",

    "summary": "Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D, side-scrolling platformer, whose gameplay centers around Sonic\u0027s ability to run at high speed through levels incorporating springs, slopes, high falls, and loop-the-loops. The levels contain hazards in the form of robots (\"badniks\" in the Western game manuals) in which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Although destroying a robot frees the animal within, this is not required to complete the game. The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes, falling into bottomless pits, being crushed by moving walls or platforms, and drowning (which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from vents). Sonic\u0027s main attack is his spin, where he curls into a ball and rotates rapidly (damaging enemies and some obstacles). This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground.\n\nScattered around each level map are gold rings and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings are a layer of protection against hazards; if Sonic has at least one ring when he collides with an enemy, he will survive. However, all his rings will be scattered; they will flicker and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again. If Sonic is hit without any rings, he loses a life. Although shields and temporary invincibility may be collected to provide additional protection, certain hazards (such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection.\n\nThe game is divided into six zones (Green Hill, Marble, Spring Yard, Labyrinth, Star Light, and Scrap Brain), each with its own visual style and enemies. A player must navigate through each zone (subdivided into three acts) to progress.\n\nAt the end of each zone\u0027s third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik (who pilots a different vehicle each time) in a boss fight. After the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with Robotnik. They begin with three lives (power-ups and rings add more), which are lost when Sonic collides with hazardous enemies (or objects) without rings, falls off-screen or exceeds an act\u0027s ten-minute time limit. Lampposts acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most-recently activated post when he loses a life. If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life, the timer will reset to 0:00 when he returns to the checkpoint. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game over screen will appear (when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives, if they have any continues).\n\nWhen Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage (a \"Secret Zone\" in the original Genesis manual). In each of six Special Stages, Sonic bounces off the bumpers and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack. Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found, their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a \"goal block\" (which ends the level).",

    "summary": "This is a completely different game than its 16-bit counterpart on the Genesis/Mega Drive, and was originally released on the Sega Game Gear and Master System.\n\nTo stop the evil Dr. Robotnik, Sonic must traverse six zones consisting of three levels each. Most of the zones are based on those in the original game, but some are entirely new, including a jungle environment and a huge airship. Other unique differences are one level that scrolls automatically and one that is aligned vertically instead of horizontally. Most of the enemies (mechanized animals, defeated by Sonic\u0027s spikes when jumping or rolling) and power-ups (speed-ups, shields, extra lives) are the same as in the Genesis version as well. Sonic can pick up golden rings for protection (when hit, he simply loses all of his rings instead of a life) and bonuses: 100 rings gain Sonic an extra life, and 50 remaining rings at the end of a level allow access to pinball-themed special stages full of bumpers and springs. The final level of a zone is always a boss fight against Robotnik. Some of the boss fights differ in the Master System and Game Gear versions of the game, with special designs for the handheld version due to the smaller visible screen area.\n\nSonic should also collect the six Chaos Emeralds to keep them from falling into Robotnik\u0027s hands. In a departure from the original game, these are not hidden in the special stages but somewhere in the regular levels.",

    "storyline": "After Sonic defeats Dr. Robotnik at the end of Sonic the Hedgehog 2, his space station, the Death Egg, crash-lands on a mystical floating landmass called Angel Island (or simply \"the Floating Island\" as it\u0027s called in the game manual). As Dr. Robotnik begins to repair the damaged station, he meets up with Knuckles the Echidna, the last surviving member of an ancient civilization of Echidnas that once inhabited the island. He is also the guardian of the Master Emerald, which grants the island its levitation powers.\n\nKnowing Sonic and Tails will try to track him down, and realizing he can use the Master Emerald to power the ship, Dr. Robotnik dupes Knuckles into believing Sonic is trying to steal his Emerald. Shortly after, Sonic and Tails in their biplane, the Tornado, are in search of Dr. Robotnik. Sonic, possessing the emeralds from the events of Sonic 2, then turns into Super Sonic. As soon as they arrive, Knuckles ambushes Sonic from underground and knocks the Chaos Emeralds from him, returning him to normal. Knuckles steals the Emeralds and disappears inland. As Sonic and Tails travel through the levels, they encounter Knuckles in almost every level, hindering their progress.\n\nIn the last level, the Launch Base Zone, the Death Egg launches off for the second time, knocking Knuckles off a pole and sending him plummeting into the water. Sonic travels to a platform on the Death Egg, fights, and defeats Robotnik for the last time. The Death Egg is seen damaged and falling after Robotnik\u0027s defeat, after which it crashes back onto Angel Island- leading into the second half of the story in Sonic \u0026 Knuckles.",
    "summary": "The game is a sequel to the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for the same system and follows on directly from the end of the game, in which Sonic defeated his enemy, Dr. Robotnik; crash-landing on a floating island, Sonic encounters new character Knuckles the Echidna, and must once more retrieve the Chaos Emeralds while also working to stop Dr. Robotnik from relaunching his ship, the Death Egg.",
