Peace has returned to the streets, the once-vacant neighborhoods are being repopulated, and prosperity has returned to the city. Adam has returned to the police force, while Axel and Blaze have moved out of the city and found jobs as a bodyguard and a dance instructor, respectively.\n\nOn the anniversary of their victory over the syndicate, Adam, Axel, and Blaze reunite to celebrate and talk about old times. The next day, however, Axel receives a frantic call from Adam\u0027s younger brother, Eddie \"Skate\" Hunter, who returned home from school to find their house completely wrecked. Worse, no one at the police station had seen or heard from Adam since early that morning. Axel and Blaze rush to investigate, and find a photo of Adam, in chains, laying at the feet of a man they know only too well. Mr. X and the Syndicate have returned, and, thirsty for revenge, have kidnapped Adam in the hopes of luring Axel and Blaze into a trap.\n\nAdam\u0027s disappearance marked the beginning of a new nightmare. Criminal elements swarmed out to reclaim the streets. Gangs roamed the parks, and bomb-wielding bikers made the roads deadly to travel at night. Beatings and lootings took place regularly and in broad daylight. Chaos reigned in the city, far worse than ever before.\n\nAxel and Blaze tried to contact their old friends at the force, the ones who once provided backup with heavy artillery. But everyone they knew had either been fired or transferred elsewhere. This time, the Syndicate was in complete control, and the two ex-cops were on their own.\n\nAssisted by Adam\u0027s brother Skate, and Axel\u0027s friend Max, Axel and Blaze set out to rescue their friend and destroy Mr. X once and for all. Standing in their way is the nastiest collection of punks and brawlers ever assembled. Add to that a force of professional fighters specially groomed to take them out of the picture!",

The game tried to focus on the confrontation between the pitcher and the batter, putting emphasis on the face-off between the two. Unfortunately, this made the perspective fairly limited in determining where to hit the ball, or even where the ball was during a pitch.",

The game was later released for the Game Boy and was included in the Japanese version of Star Fox: Assault. It is a port of the arcade game Tank Battalion with additional features (including two player simultaneous play and a level edit feature). There was also a rendition for Nintendo\u0027s Vs. System arcade cabinets.\n\nThe player, controlling a tank, must destroy enemy tanks in each level, which enter the playfield from the top of the screen. The enemy tanks attempt to destroy the player\u0027s base (represented on the map as a bird, eagle or Phoenix), as well as the human tank itself. A level is completed when the player destroys all 20 enemy tanks, but the game ends if the player\u0027s base is destroyed or the player loses all available lives.",

The brothers designed the game as a touchscreen adaptation to classic game Snake and worked on the game for over six months. It was released in December 2013 for iPad, and was later released for other iOS devices and Android. \n \nThe game received positive reviews, and critics praised the game\u0027s degree of unrestricted play.

The battle system is what differentiates Bravely Default from other RPGs. Here players can strategically choose when to initiate two complementary commands: Brave and Default. This innovative system encourages players to think carefully about strategy during every enemy encounter. Selecting \"Brave\" lets players increase the number of actions a character can take in a turn, while \"Default\" allows players to store actions for later use.",

In 2001, the game was re-released for the Game Boy Advance handheld system with new save features and minor graphical enhancements, with the English version being released in Europe for the first time.\n\nSet in a fantasy world, Breath of Fire follows the journey of a boy named Ryu, one of the last surviving members of an ancient race with the ability to transform into mighty dragons, as he searches the world for his sister. During his quest, Ryu meets other warriors who share his quest, and comes into conflict with the Dark Dragon Clan, a militaristic empire who seeks to take over the world by reviving a mad goddess. The game experienced mostly positive reception upon release, and was followed by a direct sequel, Breath of Fire II, in 1994.",

    "storyline": "The player character awakens in a cave with no memory of how he came to be there. He finds a village of Mimigas, who are being persecuted by the Doctor. The Doctor\u0027s servants Misery and Balrog are looking for Sue Sakamoto, a girl who had been transformed into a Mimiga. Not finding her, they mistakenly abduct another Mimiga named Toroko instead. The player finds Sue in the Egg Corridor, where she discovers the eggs of a Sky Dragon, which could allow her to escape the floating island if hatched. Sue attempts to rescue her brother Kazuma, but King, the leader of Mimiga Village, captures her and holds her responsible for Toroko\u0027s kidnapping. Sue tasks the player with retrieving Kazuma from Grasstown. After freeing him, they meet Professor Booster, who reveals that the Doctor plans to use the red flowers on Mimigas to create an army to take over the surface world. Booster sends the player to the Sand Zone to destroy the red flowers before the Doctor can find them. While there, the player meets Curly Brace, a female robot who also has no memories of her past, and Jenka, an old witch who is Misery\u0027s mother and guardian of the red flowers. Jenka calls the player character a \"soldier from the surface\", one of many who were sent to the island to slaughter the Mimigas.\n\nMisery transports the player to the Labyrinth deep inside the island as punishment for interfering with the Doctor\u0027s plans. Curly Brace has also been thrown into the Labyrinth and they cooperate to escape. Balrog helps them to move the boulder blocking the exit, revealing his kind nature. The pair find and defeat the Core, a magical creature whose power keeps the island afloat. However, the Doctor steps in to save it before the island collapses. Depending on certain conditions, the player may rescue Curly Brace, who had sacrificed her air tank to save the player character. When he returns to Mimiga Village, he finds that the Doctor has captured the Mimigas. In the Egg Corridor, Kazuma offers the player a choice to escape the island with him using a Sky Dragon, leading to an alternate ending in which the Doctor conquers the surface world while Kazuma and the player hide in the mountains. The player may instead choose to confront the Doctor and destroy the island\u0027s Core, which would return the Mimigas to normal. The player scales the outer wall of the island to reach the Plantation where the Doctor is using the Mimigas as slave laborers to grow red flowers. The Doctor\u0027s servants capture him and place him in a jail cell with Sue. She is taken away before the player wakes up, but her letter reveals that the Doctor was a member of the research expedition that included Sue\u0027s family and Professor Booster, but he betrayed them once he found the Demon Crown. Sue directs the player to find her mother who may have a plan to stop the Doctor.\n\nIf the player saved Curly Brace earlier, the player may find an item to restore her memories. She remembers that the player character\u0027s name is Quote, and that they were not the killer robots who slaughtered Mimigas in the past. Instead, they were sent to destroy the Demon Crown to prevent its power from falling into the wrong hands. Quote finds Sue\u0027s mother, Momorin, who is building a rocket that will allow access to the top of the island where the Doctor resides. After helping her complete the rocket, Quote confronts Misery and the Doctor. The Doctor has purified the essence of the red flowers into a crystal, which allows him to survive even after Quote destroys his body. The Doctor\u0027s spirit possesses the Core of the island, but Quote succeeds in destroying that as well, causing the island to begin falling to Earth. Under certain conditions, the player may proceed into a bonus stage called the Bloodstained Sanctuary where the creator of the Demon Crown, Ballos, is imprisoned. Ballos, Jenka\u0027s brother, was a powerful wizard who went insane after being tortured. Misery forced Ballos to create the Demon Crown, but she and Balrog became cursed to serve whoever possessed it. With the help of Curly Brace, Quote defeats Ballos and stops the source of the negative energy that was causing the island to fall, saving its inhabitants. Balrog saves the two before they are crushed by Ballos\u0027 collapsing prison—he had been sent by Misery as thanks for breaking her curse. Quote, Curly Brace, and Balrog leave the island to live out their days in peace.",

Using various objects such as floating bubbles and bellows, the candy must also be manipulated around obstacles to get to Om Nom\u0027s mouth.\n\nEach level pack introduces new challenges. Levels are scored with a zero to three star rating, according to how many stars the player picked up, and a point score depending on the number of stars collected and the amount of time taken to complete the level.

Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed.

    "storyline": "It was a relaxing, sunny day on Donkey Kong Island. Funky Kong is seen surfing and then falling off his board. He asked for Donkey Kong to join him, but the hero simply continues lounging. Cranky Kong goes up to him and complains how he never took breaks, \"whisking off maidens and throwing barrels seven days a week\", but Donkey ignores him, confident that he is a hero and that King K. Rool is gone for good. Cranky soon leaves.\n\nMeanwhile, above, Kaptain K. Rool, aboard his vessel, The Flying Krock, commands his minions to invade the island and take Donkey captive so that his next attempt at stealing the banana hoard will not be a failure and the hero will never mess with his plans again. Donkey, still lounging, did not notice the attack until Kutlasses ambushed him and took him prisoner. Kaptain K. Rool assures Donkey Kong that he will never see his precious island or his friends again.\n\nLater and back on the island, Diddy, Dixie and Cranky Kong find Donkey missing, along with a note. It reads:\nHah-arrrrh! We have got the big monkey! If you want him back, you scurvy dogs, you\u0027ll have to hand over the banana hoard!\nKaptain K. Rool\nAt this point, Wrinkly, Funky and Swanky Kong come to the scene. Cranky suggests to give up the hoard, but Diddy insists that Donkey Kong would be furious if he lost his bananas after all trouble recovering them at the last time. Diddy and Dixie Kong ride to Crocodile Isle via Enguarde the Swordfish, and then start their quest.",

They set out on adventures through the world\u0027s past and learn about its history. Upon discovering different lands in the past and solving the troubles, they reappear in the game\u0027s present-day map.\n\nThe party begins their adventure when the hero and Kiefer discover a mysterious fragment of a map that the former\u0027s father brings home from a fishing trip. Further investigations lead the hero to discover that the world he lives on, which seems to consist of only his small island, used to contain many continents that have somehow been sealed away. By placing other stone fragments found throughout the journey on pedestals in Estard\u0027s ruins, the Hero and his friends are sent to different lands in the past which the party eventually realizes. Once they solve the problems in the area\u0027s past, the landmasses appear in the present.\n\nAfter the world is restored, Orgodemir, the Demonlord, disguises himself as the Almighty and seals several of the islands away once again; this time Estard is sealed as well. The party sets out to revive the elemental spirits: Wind; Fire; Earth; and Water. Orgodemir is then revealed as the Demonlord to the world whereupon he claims to have done so to trick humanity. Orgodemir then raises the Cathedral of Blight; and with the aid of the Skystone, the party confronts him in a final battle.",

When four or more capsule halves or viruses of matching color are aligned in vertical or horizontal configurations, they are removed from play. The main objective is to complete levels, which is accomplished by eliminating all viruses from the playing field. A game over occurs if capsules fill up the playing field in a way that obstructs the bottle\u0027s narrow neck.",

He must collect secret documents from the building and traverse the 30 floors of the building using an increasingly complex series of elevators. The player is pursued by enemy agents who appear from behind closed doors. These agents must be dealt with via force or evasion. Successful completion of a level involves collecting all the secret documents and traversing the building from top to bottom. In the lower floors of the building, the elevator systems are so complex that some puzzle-solving skills are needed.\n\nThe game was available as a standard upright cabinet The controls consist of a 4-way joystick and two buttons, one for \"shoot\" and the other for jumping and kicking. The maximum number of players is two, alternating turns. The graphics are extremely simple, 2D color graphics and in-game music was composed by musician Yoshio Imamura. The game was followed by a sequel, Elevator Action II (also known as Elevator Action Returns).",

But dire challenges await even the most stalwart adventurers in Etrian Mystery Dungeon, a turn-based action RPG roguelike developed by ATLUS and Spike Chunsoft.\n\nThe Nintendo 3DS exclusive mixes Etrian Odyssey’s vast RPG party and skill customization aspects, and Mystery Dungeon’s infinitely random dungeon adventures. The action/turn based combat means that battling monsters is not just about using the right skills, but becomes an elegant Pas de Quatre of strategic positioning. Players form their parties with familiar Etrian Odyssey classes, customize individuals using Etrian-style skill trees, and then take up to four members into the dungeons. Always randomized with various levels and paths, the dungeons require plenty of exploration, not to mention the incredible loot rewards -- just be wary of what waits among the deepest depths.\"",

    "summary": "Final Fight is a side-scrolling beat-\u0027em-up produced by Capcom. Final Fight can be played by up to two players simultaneously. Before the game begins, the player chooses between the three main characters: Haggar, Cody, and Guy. Each has his own fighting style and attributes. Health gauges are displayed for both player and enemy characters.\n\nThe controls for Final Fight consist of an eight-way joystick and two buttons for attacking and jumping respectively. Pressing the attack button repeatedly when attacking an enemy or multiple enemies will cause the player character to perform a combo. The final blow of the combo can be changed to a throw if the player moves the joystick in the opposite direction just before landing it. The player can also perform a jump attack. Pressing the attack and jump buttons simultaneously allows the player to perform a special attack that strikes all surrounding enemies, but will drain a small portion of the player\u0027s health.\n\nEnemies can be grabbed simply by walking into one of them. When an enemy is grabbed, the player can perform a grab attack by pressing the attack button or perform a throw by tilting the joystick left or right. A thrown enemy can be tossed at another for additional damage. Items such as weapons, health recovery items, and items awarding extra points can be picked up by standing over one and pressing the attack button. Weapons have limited uses and will disappear if the player is disarmed by an enemy too much or when the player moves to a new area.\n\nFinal Fight consists of six stages or \"rounds\", as well as two bonus rounds. Each round takes place in a different section of Metro City such as the Slums and the Subway, with most rounds featuring more than one level. At the end of each round the player will face a boss character unique to that round.",

Along the way the player can pick up new weapons, bonuses and extra suits of armor that can help in this task.\n\nThe game is often considered very difficult by arcade standards and is commonly regarded as one of the most difficult games ever released. The game is considered by Gametrailers.com to be the world\u0027s second most difficult game ever made. The player can only be hit twice before losing a life (the first hit takes away Arthur\u0027s armor, and the player must continue on in his underwear until completing the level, or finding replacement armor). If the player loses a life, he is returned to the start of the level, or the halfway point if he has managed to get that far. Furthermore, each life can only last a certain length of time (generally around three minutes), the clock being reset at the start of a level. If the clock does run out, the player instantly loses that life. After defeating the final boss, but only with the cross weapon (if the player does not have the cross weapon, they will be prompted that it is needed to defeat the boss and restart at the beginning of level 5 and must repeat round 5 and 6 again regardless if the weapon is obtained immediately or not) for the first time the player is informed that the battle was \"a trap devised by Satan\". The player must then replay the entire game on a higher difficulty level to reach the genuine final battle.",

This follow-up to the original Kid Icarus released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987 has been at the top of gamers wish lists for years.\n\nBoasting gameplay that is easy to pick up but incredibly deep, the game is sure to satisfy novice gamers as well as fans who have been clamouring for a new installment in the franchise.\n\nThe hero, Pit, teams up with Palutena, the goddess of light, who bestows on him the miracle of flight for limited stretches. With this gift, Pit soars through the skies, shooting down swarms of enemies, then alights and engages in frantic ground-based battles against Medusas underworld army.\n\nFind and collect numerous weapons and items that offer bonuses and ability boosts. Players can choose weapons before they send Pit into battle, giving them countless layers of strategies in each level.\n\nPlayers can choose between a basic Blade, basic Claws and a basic Orbitar weapon. Blades are well-balanced, Claws have limited reach but increase running speed and the Orbitars can shoot two shots that grow in power over distance.",

Kirby\u0027s Dream Land plays like other platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit era of video games: Kirby must use various natural abilities and occasionally external abilities or items while heading toward the goal at the end of each level. Like many 1980s-era platformers, the player can accumulate points, with an extra life granted when the player has enough points. However, because Kirby lacks a save function, scores are not recorded. Also, there are no save files, so the player has to start over again when the Game Boy is turned off, if the player chooses to return to the title screen after a Game Over, or if the player resets the game. All levels are played on a two-dimensional plane, letting Kirby move only left, right, up, and down. Kirby can walk, jump, and fly. Kirby can also inhale objects and enemies, swallowing them or spitting them out as projectiles.",

The game was released on February, 21, 2012 in North America and on March 8, 2012 in Japan and Europe. It is also the first Metal Gear game to be released on a Nintendo-developed portable system since Metal Gear: Ghost Babel, back in 2000. A digital download version was released in Japan via the Nintendo eShop function on the Nintendo 3DS on December 16, 2014, exactly a decade after the initial release of the original title. The download includes a Snake Eater theme, which included a FOX logo wallpaper, the theme song for the game, cursor sound effects from the Metal Gear series, and folders modeled after the cardboard boxes from the series. Both the digital download for the game itself as well as the 3DS theme were later released in both Europe and North America on December 18, with the game itself costing $19.99. A patch was released a day later to fix a glitch occurring in the WIG area that freezes the game and corrupts save data when using the Circle Pad Pro",

    "storyline": "The game begins with Samus Aran acting as a bodyguard for the Biologic\u0027s research team on planet SR388. Eventually, a Hornoad confronts them and is killed by Samus. However, a globular yellow organism (an X) emerges from the Hornoad as it is destroyed and enters Samus\u0027s body.\nFeeling no initial effects, Samus continues escorting the researchers and completes the assignment. On the way back to the laboratory, however, Samus loses consciousness, and her gunship crashes into an asteroid belt. The ship\u0027s emergency systems automatically ejected Samus\u0027 escape pod, saving her from the crash, but her gunship is completely destroyed. Samus is quickly attended to by a medical crew, who discover that the creature that entered her body on SR388 was actually a parasitic organism that they soon named X.\n\nSamus Infected 2\nSamus, infected by the X Parasites.\nThe organic components of Samus\u0027s Power Suit had become so integrated with her system that it could not be removed while she was unconscious. Large portions of her infected suit had to be surgically removed, dramatically altering its appearance. However, the X in Samus\u0027s central nervous system were too embedded to be removed safely; Samus\u0027s chances of survival were lower than one percent.\nMetroids are the only known predator of the X; however, since Samus destroyed all the Metroids on SR388 in a previous mission, the X were able to multiply unchecked. Seeing this as the key to curing her, doctors proposed using a Metroid cell from Samus\u0027 dead Baby Metroid to make an anti-X vaccine. Apparently, the Federation had managed to preserve a cell culture from the Baby that saved Samus while she was on Zebes a second time. The serum was prepared and injected without delay, completely eradicating the X. There were, however, two side effects: Samus could no longer be hurt by normal X and could even absorb them to replenish health and ammunition, but she also inherited the Metroids\u0027 vulnerability to cold.\n\nUpon recovering, Samus is sent to investigate an explosion on the Biologic Space Laboratories research station, where the specimens from SR388 and the infected pieces of her Power Suit are being held. Once she arrives at the station, Samus immediately heads to the Quarantine Bay, where she encounters and kills a Hornoad that has been infected by an X parasite. Samus speaks with her new gunship\u0027s computer (whom she has named \"Adam\", as it reminds her of a former CO) and learns that the specimens brought back by the field team have become infected by the X. The computer also reveals that the X can use the DNA of its prey to create a perfect copy, meaning any organic life on the station may also be infected.\n\nSA-X 1\nThe SA-X.\nAs she continues to explore the station, Samus discovers that the X have used the infected portions of her Power Suit to create a copy of Samus herself, dubbed the SA-X (or Samus Aran-X). Since the SA-X arose from Samus\u0027s fully-upgraded Power Suit, it has all of her powered-up abilities, as evidenced by it using a Power Bomb to escape the Quarantine Bay. By exploding the bomb, the SA-X also destroyed the capsules holding the X specimens, releasing them all into the station. Well into her investigation of the station, Samus stumbles upon the facility\u0027s Restricted Lab. Here, she finds dozens of infant Metroids and several more Metroids in various stages of maturity, all in stasis; these were the results of a cloning project of which Samus was not previously aware. Shortly after Samus discovers them, the SA-X attempts to destroy its predators, but its plan backfires: the Metroids break free and the emergency fail-safes are activated as a result. Samus barely escapes before the lab locks down completely and is jettisoned from the station, exploding over SR388.\nAfter the incident at the Restricted Lab, Samus speaks with her ship\u0027s computer, who is angry about the discovery and subsequent destruction of the Metroids. The computer explains that the Federation had been secretly working on a Metroid breeding program, for \"peaceful applications\". The computer reveals that the station\u0027s SRX environment, a replica of the SR388 ecosystem, was ideal for raising Alpha, Gamma, Zeta, and even Omega Metroids. The research uncovered techniques for rapid growth, allowing an infant grow into an Omega Metroid in mere days. Unfortunately, the SA-X had been tracking Samus down and followed her to the lab\u0027s location. Much to Samus\u0027s surprise, the computer also mentions that the SA-X has been reproducing asexually and there are no fewer than 10 aboard the station.\n\nLater, the computer tells Samus that she has caused enough damage and instructs her to leave the rest of the investigation to the Federation. Apparently, the Federation has taken an interest in the X and SA-X and believe that this life-form has endless applications. Samus, having seen the SA-X\u0027s destructive capabilities firsthand, is strongly against this. She is convinced that the X will overwhelm the Federation troops as soon as they land, absorbing their powers and knowledge in the process. If this happens, they could easily spread throughout the galaxy and \"galactic civilization will end.\"\n\nAs an alternative, Samus decides to activate the station\u0027s self-destruct mechanism in order to destroy the X, risking her own life in the process. However, her ship\u0027s computer has locked Samus in a Navigation Room, as the Federation has ordered it to keep her confined until their arrival. Desperate, Samus yells at the computer: \"Don\u0027t let them do this. Can\u0027t you see what will happen, Adam?\" Puzzled at the use of the name, the computer inquires as to who this Adam was. Samus reveals that he had been her previous commanding officer and had died saving her life. Apparently moved by Samus\u0027s revelation, the computer agrees with the plan, and suggests that if Samus were to alter the station\u0027s orbit, then she might be able to include the planet in the explosion, thus ensuring the destruction of the X on planet SR388 as well as those on the station. At this point, Samus realizes that her ship\u0027s computer truly is Adam Malkovich, whose personality had been uploaded to a computer prior to his death.\n\nSamus hurries to the Operations Room, where she is confronted by an SA-X. She manages to defeat it, but its Core-X escapes before she can absorb it. Ignoring its escape, Samus initiates the self-destruct sequence and hurries back to her ship. However, she finds the docking bay in ruins and her ship gone. Before she can react to the situation, an Omega Metroid appears, apparently having escaped from the Restricted Lab before its destruction and grown to full size in record time. Samus possesses no weapon capable of damaging the Metroid, and a single swipe of its claw reduces her energy reserves to one unit. As the Omega Metroid prepares to finish her off, the SA-X returns, and attacks the Metroid with its Ice Beam, injuring it. However, it was greatly weakened from its fight with Samus and is quickly defeated by the Metroid. This time, the Core-X hovers over Samus, allowing her to absorb it and obtain the \"Unnamed Suit\" as well as the Ice Beam and restoring her genetic condition to its pre-vaccine state. Using her regained abilities, Samus fights and kills the Omega Metroid after a fierce struggle. After the battle, Samus\u0027s ship reenters the bay, having been piloted by the computer, Adam, and the same Etecoons and Dachoras she saved on the previous mission to Zebes and later on the Habitation Deck.\n\nAs Samus leaves the station, it is shown crashing into SR388, destroying both the station and the planet, ridding the universe of the X forever.\n\nReflecting on her actions, Samus doubts people will understand why she destroyed the X, nor will they realize the danger that was barely averted. Samus believes she will be held responsible for defying the Federation, but Adam comforts her, telling her: \"Do not worry. One of them will understand. One of them must.\" A final reflection, Samus goes on to say: \"we are all bound by our experiences. They are the limits of our consciousness. But in the end, the human soul will ever reach for the truth... This is what Adam taught me.\"",

    "storyline": "This story takes place directly after the events in Mystery Case Files: Return to Ravenhearst. The player is driving through a decrepit town called Dire Grove, which appears to be deserted. The weather forecast has predicted a heavy snowstorm and the player has no other option but to explore the deserted town for shelter. The player sees an abandoned car and finds a camcorder in it. The footage shows a teenaged girl crying and pleading the player to save them. The player also finds a cryptic note: \"She is real. The legend is real.\".\nAs the player explores the surrounding, they realize that all the villagers have evacuated due to the snowstorm, so the player has to do everything by themself. The player learns that the girl in the footage is Alison Sterling, a collegiate who has chosen the Celtic legend of the Banshee as a subject for research. She arrived here with 3 friends and all four of them are missing. The player also learns that Dr. Patricia Anderson, an archaeologist had unearthed some relics only some days ago.\nThe player eventually learns about the legend of the Banshee. Apparently a farmer, a fisherman, a hunter and a blacksmith performed a ritual 1000 years ago to open a portal to talk to their kin in the spirit world. When the dead started attacking the living, they offered a young woman to appease the ghosts and close the portal. This woman became the Banshee and is trying to come back. The player also find that all the students have been subdued and hypnotized by the Banshee. Dr. Anderson\u0027s recording proves that the relics unearthed by her are maybe the keys to the portal.\nThe player is left with only one option: open the portal and send the Banshee back to the spirit world. Only after opening the portal the player realizes that the Banshee has tricked them into freeing her spirit. The player races against time, trapping the Banshee\u0027s spirit again and saved the students. In the end, Alison gives a lecture about the events at Dire Grove, where she is given by a big applause by a huge number of audience, including her friends. An audience member asks her about your identity, but she says: \"That person has asked to remain nameless, but I can give you their business card.\"\nShe flashes a card, and a Mystery Case Files logo is seen and the credits start rolling.",

The player controls Pac-Man through a maze, eating pac-dots (also called pellets or just dots). When all pac-dots are eaten, Pac-Man is taken to the next stage. Four enemies (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde) roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man. If an enemy touches Pac-Man, a life is lost and the Pac-Man itself withers and dies. When all lives have been lost, the game ends. Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as power pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the enemies. The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next, generally becoming shorter as the game progresses.",

However, in the game\u0027s second case, Mia is murdered for being aware of corporate blackmail, and her younger sister Maya Fey is charged with the crime because her name was found on a piece of evidence. While defending her, Phoenix is reintroduced to another childhood friend, Miles Edgeworth, who is the prosecutor for Maya\u0027s case and has established himself as a \"genius\" for the prosecution system. Maya is found not guilty of the crime, and becomes Phoenix\u0027s assistant in further cases, offering her channeling ability as a \"Spirit Medium\" of Kurain village to bring the spirit of Mia to help at critical times. Phoenix and Edgeworth find that while they have their friendship from their youth, they continue to face off against each other in the courtroom. In the third case, Phoenix and Maya investigate the murder of a famous actor.In the fourth case, Edgeworth is charged with murder, and Phoenix steps up to defend him. It is discovered that Edgeworth was set up by his old mentor, Manfred von Karma. Several years earlier, Manfred shot and killed Edgeworth\u0027s father, a defense attorney, after he ruined Manfred\u0027s perfect record, but led Edgeworth to believe he shot his own father. Phoenix is able to expose Manfred\u0027s cover-up and achieve a \"not guilty\" verdict for Edgeworth. After the case, Edgeworth thinks about taking time off from his position to consider the events, while Maya announces she is going back to her home in Kurain Village to train.\nThe fifth case, added for the Nintendo DS, iOS, and Wii versions, has Ema Skye begging Wright for help to defend her older sister Lana, who is on trial for murder, compounded by a second murder of the same apparent victim in a different building at the same time. Using Ema\u0027s scientific help to establish evidence and the surprising prosecution help of Edgeworth during the trial, Phoenix is able to learn that Lana Skye was blackmailed by the Chief of Police Damon Gant into covering for a murder she thought that Ema had committed several years before. Gant himself is revealed to have committed the murder and pinned the blame on Ema. Though Lana is cleared of murder charges, she willingly goes to jail for being an accomplice; Ema says her goodbyes as she heads to Europe to study forensic science.",

The legal system has entered a dark era, filled with false charges and fabricated evidence. The Wright Anything Agency, run by Phoenix Wright, who retakes the bar exam to once again become a defense attorney following the previous game, takes on a newly christened lawyer named Athena Cykes, who specialises in analytical psychology, joining his other young attorney, Apollo Justice. Working together, Apollo and Athena tackle the case of a murdered alderman, facing up against Simon Blackquill, a fierce prosecutor who is ordered to stand in court despite currently serving a murder sentence (in the game\u0027s second case). Afterwards, Athena defends her childhood friend, Juniper Woods, after she is charged with the murder of her teacher at a law school, receiving help from prosecutor Klavier Gavin (third case).",
    "summary": "Dual Destinies continues the style of gameplay from previous installments, in which the player must utilize evidence and find contradictions in witness statements to prove their client innocent. Like previous installments, gameplay is split up between Investigations, in which players find evidence and question witnesses, and Trials, where they must use the evidence to expose contradictions. The game now features full 3D graphics and character models, allowing more dynamic camera angles during gameplay, such as quickly panning around the courtroom in the moments before a dramatic reveal. The 3D camera also allows investigation sequences to take place in 3D spaces, permitting greater investigative depth, such as being able to rotate around a room to look for clues.",

Working closely with Williams to ensure authenticity of each of the games, the collection is highlighted by some of the most popular and innovative Williams pinball tables, including Gorgar, the first-ever talking pinball machine, Black Knight, which introduced \"Magna-Save\" and Bonus Ball, and Space Shuttle, which took the pinball industry by storm in 1984. Every table has been meticulously recreated to bring players the visuals, sound effects and gameplay that made these games legendary successes. Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection harkens back to the arcades of the 1980s. Players begin Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection with access to four pinball tables, and the remaining four tables are unlocked as the game progresses. Players can spend as little as two minutes on a quick pinball challenge, or delve deeper into the game, gaining rewards in a token-based system as they unlock each of the pinball tables. Single-player Arcade and Challenge modes provide hours of solo entertainment, and a Multiplayer mode lets players face each other head-on.",

When three or more tiles link up in a up/down or left/right fashion, they disappear. Gravity kicks in and settles the rest of the tiles into the bin ? this can cause a chain reaction to occur since other blocks of the same color can fall into place next to each other. It\u0027s up to you to continuously work the bin to wipe out tiles by making combination connections and chain reactions. That\u0027s the game in a nutshell, but there are several modes of play that\u0027ll keep your fingers busy. In the game\u0027s Challenge mode, for example, you\u0027re up against a computer opponent and you\u0027ll have to make combos and chain reactions to send garbage blocks to his unseen screen -- but keep in mind your opponent\u0027s doing the same to you.",

The objectives remain the same as well, though some differences exist along the way. For example, in the beginning, the player is not given an option of choosing one of three starters. Instead, a wild Pikachu that Professor Oak catches becomes player\u0027s Pokémon, while the rival character takes an Eevee that was intended for the player. The plot takes from the anime, and features characters that were not featured in the game or have been enhanced to resemble their anime characters, including Jessie, James, Meowth, Nurse Joy and Officer Jenny. Similar to the anime, Pikachu refuses to evolve. Players are also given the opportunity to obtain the original three starters. As players quest on, they collect more Pokémon and use them to defeat the eight Gym Leaders and eventually the Elite Four, all the while battling Team Rocket, a gang devoted to using Pokémon in order to make themselves more powerful.",

    "summary": "PES 2014 was being developed with six key elements in mind, that will define the physics and the features of the game. PES 2014 will center everything on the ball: how it moves, and how players use it. Physics of the ball, stature of the player, speed and height of the pass, everything will be taken into account to recreate the most realistic football experience on a home system. Players will be an important part of the game with Motion Animation Stability System (M.A.S.S.), that will increase the realism of physical contacts between players, tackles and decisions taken on the pitch by the AI to have more open games. The audience will have an influence on the performance of the team. On the pitch, the performance of an individual player, good or bad, will also have an effect on the team, giving them a moral boost if he has a moment of individual brilliance; or forcing his teammates to support him if he is not doing well. \n\nIntroduced in PES 2013, the Player ID system recreated faithfully the movements and skills of about 50 star players. In PES 2014, that number is increased and will also apply to complete squads to replicate a team\u0027s playing style. With the new Combination Plan, users will be able set up a variety of different tactics in key areas of the pitch using three or more players. These players will make very different runs to exploit holes in the defense or midfield, using the flanks, curved runs, or overlapping play to make themselves available.\n\nNew for this year, players can now change teams in the Master League and coach a national side. Players are also able to create 3rd and 4th kits. Some third and fourth kits are official. The PS2 version has the same characteristics of the other versions. UEFA Europa League also appears as a single-mode.",

Use the Wii U GamePad to become the malevolent ColourMaster controlling the colours and the obstacles in the level, or tackle our toughest game mode, The Bowhemoth, a 30+ minute platforming challenge that will put the patience and skill of even the toughest players to the test. \n \nIf dozens of game modes, hundreds of unlockable costumes, and a crazy, colourful gaming challenge sounds like fun, then you better get ready to Runbow!",

Learn to predict your foes’ moves, deftly dodge their attacks, and create opportunities for devastating counterattacks.\n\nStart with the Sakura Sword, a little health, and some basic training from your water-spirit guide. Make your way from battleground to battleground fighting wave after wave of increasingly cunning enemies. Fight through huge castles to duel epic bosses.

Most of the zones are based on those in the original game, but some are entirely new, including a jungle environment and a huge airship. Other unique differences are one level that scrolls automatically and one that is aligned vertically instead of horizontally. Most of the enemies (mechanized animals, defeated by Sonic\u0027s spikes when jumping or rolling) and power-ups (speed-ups, shields, extra lives) are the same as in the Genesis version as well. Sonic can pick up golden rings for protection (when hit, he simply loses all of his rings instead of a life) and bonuses: 100 rings gain Sonic an extra life, and 50 remaining rings at the end of a level allow access to pinball-themed special stages full of bumpers and springs. The final level of a zone is always a boss fight against Robotnik. Some of the boss fights differ in the Master System and Game Gear versions of the game, with special designs for the handheld version due to the smaller visible screen area.\n\nSonic should also collect the six Chaos Emeralds to keep them from falling into Robotnik\u0027s hands. In a departure from the original game, these are not hidden in the special stages but somewhere in the regular levels.",

The player controls Rusty who is equipped with a pickaxe but the player is given options to upgrade the tools used for digging as progression is made in the game. Besides health, the player also needs coal for light, and water for special abilities.\nSteamWorld Dig has platform elements in that the player runs, jumps and encounter foes, but the main objective is mining. That means that the player builds – or rather deconstructs – the game world and creates platforms that way. The player collects resources and other hidden resources which can be brought back to the surface and exchanged for cash. When the player progress in the game new abilities are unlocked. Each playthrough, the mines are randomized, making items and treasure appear in different locations. If the player gets stuck there is a self destruct function, but the players can also buy ladders in the store at the surface to get out of tricky situations.\nWhen progressing deeper down in the cave, the player encounters various enemies with different attack patterns and weak spots. The game features multiple worlds, each with a completely different environment. Dying results in a reparation penalty fee, and the player respawns back on the surface. All the loot that has been accumulated when the player dies can be picked up again.",

The game is both a sequel and a remake to the previous year\u0027s Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors\u0027 Dreams, which is itself a prequel to the Street Fighter II series in terms of plot and setting.\n\nThe single-player mode, much like the original Street Fighter Alpha, consists of eight matches with computer-controlled opponents, including a fixed final opponent whose identity depends on the player\u0027s selected character. Each character also has a secret \"rival\" whom they can face during the course of the single-player mode after meeting certain requirements, in which then the rival will interrupt one of the player\u0027s regularly scheduled matches and exchange dialogue with the player\u0027s character. With Akuma now a regular character, a more powerful version of the character dubbed \"Shin Akuma\" replaces him as a secret opponent. Unlike Super Turbo and the original Alpha, Shin Akuma challenges the player before the player\u0027s final opponent, rather than as an alternate final boss.",

They decided to go to a nearby mountain for a picnic.\n\nAfter arriving at the picnic area and looking at the scenery, they see a small cave nearby.

The game follows largely the same formula of its aforementioned predecessor, with Mario defeating enemies by jumping on them and collecting coins and power ups by hitting floating blocks, with each world leading up to a boss fight which is defeated using by collapsing the floor. A unique feature of this instalment is two scrolling shoot-\u0027em-up levels, the first of which Mario pilots a submarine, and the second an aeroplane.",

With the seasons in tumult and the forces of evil running rampant, the world looks for a hero... and finds Link. His quest won\u0027t be easy - he\u0027ll have to master the seasons themselves if he\u0027s to turn back the evil tide.",
    "summary": "Transform the world around you with the Rod of Seasons, and create order from chaos. Stop a power-hungry general named Onox, and rescue Din, the Oracle of Seasons, to save the troubled land of Holodrum.\n\nChange the seasons to overcome puzzling obstacles. If Link finds a small plant at the bottom of a cliff, change the season to summer, and Link can use the newly grown Deku Flower to boost up to the top. If Link faces a deep lake, use the Rod of Seasons to shift into winter, letting Link walk over the ice.\n\nReleased on the Game Boy Color system in 2001, The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages and The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons represent the pinnacle of classic 2D Zelda gameplay.\n\nWhen played together, these two games offer an ultimate adventure not possible when each game is experienced on its own. The games feature a link system that unlocks access to additional content that you can\u0027t access any other way.",
