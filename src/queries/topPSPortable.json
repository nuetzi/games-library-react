    "storyline": "During a journey, the human nobleman Kain is ambushed and killed by a band of assassins. Mortanius offers him the chance to exact revenge — Kain assents, heedless of the cost, and awakes as a vampire. Once he kills his attackers, Mortanius tells him that, while they were the instruments of his death, they were not the ultimate cause. In search of the truth, and a cure to his vampiric curse, Kain travels to the Pillars of Nosgoth. There, Ariel explains that he has to destroy the Circle of Nine before he can realize peace. Kain begins by tracking down and killing Nupraptor, and then confronts Malek, but their duel ends in a stalemate. To defeat Malek, Kain solicits the advice of the Oracle of Nosgoth. The Oracle forewarns him of the Legions of the Nemesis, and instructs him to seek out Vorador, Malek\u0027s old adversary. When the two meet, Vorador welcomes Kain, and offers his assistance, but urges the fledgling to embrace vampirism and refrain from interfering in the affairs of mankind.\n\nHaunted by the elder vampire, who serves as an example of what he will become if he fails to find a cure, Kain persists, and, in a decisive showdown, Vorador vanquishes Malek while Kain kills Bane the Druid and DeJoule the Energist. Later, after he slays Azimuth the Planer and recovers a time-streaming device, Ariel informs Kain that he must instead prioritize the war against The Nemesis, whose armies threaten to conquer Willendorf. Kain convinces King Ottmar to rally his troops against the Legions in a final stand, but the battle proves disastrous. Ottmar perishes, the Willendorf forces are overwhelmed, and Kain, cornered, uses the time-streaming device to escape. He emerges 50 years in the past, and kills the younger version of The Nemesis from this era—the beloved King William the Just—to trigger a temporal paradox which expunges the Legions from the timestream. However, when Kain returns to the present day, he discovers that William\u0027s murder has sparked a renewed vampire purge.\n\nThe Oracle of Nosgoth — revealed to be Moebius the Time Streamer, a member of the Circle — leads the genocidal crusade, and, having masterminded Kain\u0027s actions from the outset, consummates his trap by executing Vorador. Kain kills Moebius, but is left the last of his kind. At the Pillars, he witnesses Mortanius arguing with Anarcrothe the Alchemist, who reveals that Mortanius is a guardian, and culpable for both Ariel and Kain\u0027s deaths. Seduced by The Dark Entity, Mortanius was unwillingly controlled and forced to kill Ariel. To correct the imbalance, he created Kain, a creature potent enough to destroy the Circle. Mortanius slays Anarcrothe, and then succumbs to possession from The Dark Entity (the latter one being responsible behind everything that happened in Nosgoth) whom Kain defeats. With only one Pillar left unrestored, Kain reaches an epiphany: he himself is the final insane Circle member, Ariel\u0027s unwitting successor as guardian of balance, culled in the brief interval between her death and the Pillars\u0027 corruption. The \"cure\" to vampirism which he sought is his own death.\n\nPlayers can choose whether to heal the world — an ending in which Kain sacrifices his life, ensuring the extinction of the vampires and restoration of Nosgoth — or damn the world, in which case the Pillars collapse, leaving Nosgoth an irredeemable wasteland, with Kain fully embracing his curse and living on as the most powerful entity in the land. The latter choice is considered the canon ending leading to the rest of the series.",

    "storyline": "Plot\n\nCaptain Commando is set in the crime-ridden future of Metro City in the year 2026, where a superhero named Captain Commando, assisted by his three faithful Commando Companions rise up to protect the Earth and all the Galaxy from a gang of super-powered criminals.\n\nCharacters\n\nCaptain Commando (キャプテンコマンドー Kyaputen Komandō?) - He is the leader of the \"Commando Team\". Besides his powerful mind and strong body, he also uses his \"Energy Gloves,\" whicn can shoot mighty bolts of fire and electricity.[1] His killer technique is the \"Captain Collider\". Striking the ground with his Energy Gloves causes an electric shock which kills everyone around him. Captain Commando\u0027s dash attacks are \"Captain Cannon\" (also known as \"Captain Fire\") which torches the enemy with a blast of flame and \"Captain Kick\" which can hit several enemies at once on the ground or in the air.[1] Captain Commando also can grab his opponent and kick their stomach or throw their whole body. Other things he uses are the \"Captain Goggles\" which help him identify a criminal\u0027s face at a distance of 2 km, by comparing with data base, the \"Captain Protector\" which is made of super-tough material called \"Captanium\" and stands up to trillion degree heat, the \"Captain Gauntlet\" which multiplies Captain\u0027s power 48 times making it easy for him to smash a thick iron plate and the \"Captain Boots\" which make it possible for him to take a 100-meter fall without injuries or damage to the boots.[1]\n\nMack the Knife (ジェネティー Jenetī?, Jennety in the Japanese version) - The Mummy Commando is a mummy-like alien from outer space.[1] As weapons he uses sub-sonic knives that melt any enemy he hits. His killer technique is the \"Spinning Attack\".[1] Spinning round like a top, his bandages lash his enemies like whips. Mack\u0027s dash attacks are \"Double Trouble\" which sticks his enemy with both knives and \"Sky Assault\" which is an airborne version of Double Trouble. Mack also can grab his enemy and either stick or throw them. Other things he has are the \"Captain Cap\" which is a souvenir from the first meeting with Captain Commando, the \"Genetic Bandage\" which is his life-sustaining equipment for survival on Earth, the \"Genetic Knife\" which melts all matter and the \"Gravity Controllers\" which are his pair of shoes that adjust the gravitational pull to where it\u0027s best for the battles.[1] Mack\u0027s name comes from the Bertolt Brecht song of the same title.\n\nGinzu the Ninja (翔 Shō?, Sho in the Japanese version) - The Ninja Commando is a highly trained ninja and successor to Bushin-ryu Ninpo, a fighting style of ninjutsu that was also inherited by Guy from Final Fight. His razor-sharp sword is capable of cutting an opponent in two.[2] His killer technique is his \"Smoke Bomb\". After creating a smoke screen around his body, the smoke explodes, killing his enemies that are adjacent.[2] Ginzu\u0027s dash attacks are \"Iaizuki\" which pierces several enemies at once and \"Flying Katana\" which cuts the enemies from above while jumping. Ginzu can grab his opponents and either kick their stomach or do a shoulder throw or overhead throw. Other things he is equipped with are his \"Ninja Eyes\" which can help him find enemies 500 meters ahead in pitch dark, his \"Servant Sword\" serves no one but him, is named \"Lightning Light\" and cuts things at atomic levels and his \"Ninja Suit\" which is tougher than iron and softer than silk.[2] He is the only character who is able to throw shurikens to his opponents.\n\nBaby Head (フーバー Fūbā?, Hoover in the Japanese version) - The Baby Commando is a super genius infant who fights using a robot of his own design. His robot is both strong and quick. His killer technique is his \"Knee Rocket\" which launches a missile from the robot\u0027s knee[2] which are constantly manufactured within the robot. Baby Head\u0027s dash attacks are \"Rolling Punch\" which is a strong punch that spins like a drill and \"Elbow Smash\" which crushes the enemy under an elbow blow coming off a jump [2] Baby Head can grab his enemies and do either a knee kick, a \"Pile-driver\" or a \"Fling-away\". Other features he uses are the \"Talking Machine\" which resembles a baby pacifier and allows him to speak the 3 million languages of the cosmo, the \"Stable Cradle\" which keeps the robot from rocking, no matter how far it\u0027s tilted, the \"Silverfist Vehicle\" which has 12,000 horsepower, 582 kilograms (1280.4 pounds) of bodyweight and mounts fuzzy-logic control, the \"Missile Launcher\" which is a missile production facility built inside the leg, as well as in the Silvervest Vehicle and is nicknamed by Baby Head\u0027s friends \"Baby Carriage\" and the \"Jet Hover\" which is used for high-speed position shifting.[2]\nGameplay[edit]",

However, according to the legend, every hundred years a group of \"armored beasts\" emerge from \"the dark core of the earth\" to serve their master, the Queen Pede, and aid her in the destruction of the Wee people. Every time this happens a magic stick is employed to find a hero to defend them. Every time the insects are defeated, the villagers believe that the threat has permanently ended; but they always return, as the legend indicates.\n\nThe player plays as Wally, the chosen hero to fight the insects that century, who is to take control of the shooter, a vehicle made for, as its name indicates, rendering shots against the insect menace. Thus, the player embarks a journey across five worlds: Weedom, Frostonia, Inferium, Enigma, and Evile (each consisting of about 5 levels each, with the final level of each including a boss that must be defeated), in order to end the curse forever.",
    "summary": "Enter the world of the Wee People and do your best to save them from the QueenPede, who will stop at nothing to destroy this peaceful race of humanoids. In this remake of the classic Atari game, players take the role of Wally, the village\u0027s humble bean counter, as he is quickly recruited to man the village bug shooter and sent off to save the colony from the ruthless QueenPede and her destructive subjects -- the spiders, scorpions, and fleas -- as she sets out to conquer the peaceful wee people. Work your way through all-new 3D worlds with new weapons and skills. And if you\u0027re really good, you might just discover the original Centipede.",

There, he creates a time paradox which erases the dictator from history, and returns to his starting point. \n \nWith Nazi Germany removed from history, the Soviet Union is left unopposed as Joseph Stalin sees an opportunity to expand into Eastern Europe. In response, most of Europe ally against this new threat, and start a desperate war against the new aggressor.",

Crash is able to defeat enemies by either jumping on them or using a spinning attack that launches them. Crash will lose a life if he is hit by an enemy or obstacle, or falls into a bottomless pit. Crash can protect himself by collecting Aku Aku masks, which protect Crash from a single hit from an enemy or obstacle (but not pits or other instant-death obstacles). Crash can hold onto two masks at a time and, upon collecting a third mask, will gain temporary invincibility. The game ends when the player runs out of lives, with more lives earned by finding extra life items or by collecting 100 Wumpa Fruits.",

The introduction shows Jak being captured, while Daxter manages to escape. Almost two years later (having no luck with rescuing Jak), Daxter has forgotten all about finding his friend. An old man named Osmo, whom Daxter meets, hires Daxter as an exterminator working in various parts of Haven City, and occasionally its environs, to exterminate bug-like Metal Heads referred to in-game as \u0027Metal Bugs\u0027. During his adventures, Daxter meets a mysterious woman named Taryn who, despite being less than impressed by Daxter\u0027s interest in her, occasionally helps him. \n \nAfter completing a number of missions for Osmo, Daxter sees Jak in a Prison Zoomer and attempts to chase after it. After being cornered by some Krimzon Guards (who had noticed Daxter\u0027s pursuit), Daxter is rescued by Osmo\u0027s son Ximon, who assists him with several more missions including one to Baron Praxis\u0027 palace where Daxter steals a map of the Fortress, the prison where Jak is being held. After returning to the extermination shop, an arthropod sidekick that Daxter acquired earlier is killed by Kaeden, a bitter man who seemingly wants to steal Osmo\u0027s shop, but, in actuality, is working for Kor, the Metal Head leader. \n \nWhen Daxter tries to stop Kaeden from escaping the shop, Kaeden suddenly blows up the shop with a bomb he placed in the shop earlier. Daxter and Osmo survive, and Daxter promises to stop Kaeden, but only after he rescues Jak. Daxter infiltrates the Fortress and finds Kaeden, who reveals himself to be a giant Metal Bug. Daxter manages to defeat Kaeden, who tries to warn him that Kor is waiting outside for them, and then uses a hover platform to begin searching for Jak within the Fortress, leading into the opening cutscene from Jak II. After this, the game cuts to a point later in the timeline at Daxter\u0027s Naughty Ottsel Bar, where he is recounting the story to Jak, Keira, Samos, Tess and Taryn.",

    "storyline": "The story of Disgaea opens with Laharl rising out of an open coffin in his room. Etna, one of the castle vassals, is standing next to him, surrounded by various weapons. She explains that he has been sleeping for two years, far longer than he intended, and his father, King Krichevskoy, has died. Laharl vows to reclaim the throne, and, after consulting with Etna and his other vassals, goes to Vyers\u0027 castle. \n \nAfter defeating the demon Vyers, who refers to himself as the \"Dark Adonis\" and is renamed \"Mid-Boss\" by Laharl, he meets Angel Trainee Flonne. Flonne had been sent to the Netherworld by Seraph Lamington, the ruler of Celestia, to assassinate King Krichevskoy (who was already dead). Shocked by Laharl\u0027s lack of grief at his father\u0027s death, the eternally optimistic Flonne joins Laharl\u0027s party to determine if demons are capable of feeling love. Observing them in secret is the paranoid Archangel Vulcanus, who interprets Flonne\u0027s actions as treason and is convinced that she is plotting against him. \n \nAfter Etna demands that Laharl pay the salary of the Prinnies that she has hired, he decides to attack the demon with the most money in the vicinity. This is Hoggmeiser at Dinero Palace. After defeating Hoggmeiser, Laharl is about to kill him, until Hoggmeiser\u0027s son rushes out and gets in the way. Flonne convinces Laharl to spare them, and Laharl lets them keep some of the money. In response to this act, Hoggmeiser joins the party. \n \nAt one point, Flonne and Etna discover a photograph of Laharl in an embarrassing situation. Laharl refers to this as a \"paparazzi shot\", however, the actual contents of the photo are never actually revealed. A threat on the back of the photograph states that copies of it would be distributed if Laharl did not accept a challenge to fight for the overlordship; thus Laharl was blackmailed. \n \nResponding to this challenge, Laharl meets Maderas, a vampire. He was banished by King Krichevskoy, for stealing the King\u0027s favorite snack, black pretzels. Maderas takes advantage of Laharl\u0027s two biggest weaknesses – optimism and women with sexy bodies. Maderas was also controlling Etna by holding her memory. He had instructed her to kill the prince, but she had put him to sleep for two years by poisoning him instead. Etna eventually betrays Maderas, and along with Laharl, Flonne, and Mid-Boss, defeats him. \n \nWaking up later at night, Flonne discovers that several Prinnies are chanting and leaving the castle. Laharl, worried that his reputation will be tarnished if it is discovered that he let his vassals escape, chases after them the next morning. Eventually, he runs into Death, and the player learns that Big Sis Prinny is actually Laharl\u0027s mother; she became a Prinny because she gave her life to save him.",
    "summary": "Disgaea is a tactical role playing game. Battle gameplay takes place on a map divided into a square grid. The player controls a squad of humanoid units and monsters, which each occupy a single square of the grid and do combat with a group of enemies. Depending on the character and attack selected, the player will be able to deal damage to a specific enemy unit or a designated region of the map. Combat ends when all enemy units or all of the player\u0027s units are destroyed. \nHumanoid characters may lift and throw other units across the map in order to allow allies to move further or force enemies to keep their distance. This even allows the player to capture enemies by throwing them into the base panel; these enemies then become allies, and can be used on subsequent maps. The chance of capturing an enemy in this manner depends on several factors. Failure to capture the enemy will result in the death of all characters inside the base panel, and the enemy will survive.",

Characters can be improved through learning skills and equipping items. The battle system is turn-based, and dungeon navigation takes place from a first-person perspective on a grid map. Party members can belong to five main classes (namely fighters, magic users, scouts, maids and spielers) which branch into over 30 different subclasses with unique skill sets and outfits as characters progress in specialization. For instance, a fighter can develop into a paladin and a valkyrie, while magic users can transition into enchantresses and witches.",

At the start of the game, the player may choose to play as either a male or female character, as well as selecting one of three Servants — Saber, Archer, or Caster, each with different strengths and weaknesses. Players spend one ingame \"week\" interacting with other characters, viewing scenes that advance the game\u0027s story, talking to their Servant in their room, and gathering clues to the identity of the enemy Servant. At the end of each day, they enter the Arena, a dungeon in which they can battle monsters to gain experience points and strengthen their Servant. The game\u0027s turn-based battle system is comparable to rock-paper-scissors -- \"Attack\" overpowers \"Break\", Break overpowers \"Guard\", and Guard overpowers Attack. During battle, both the player and the opponent line up six such moves at the beginning of each turn.",

The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game feature an improved game engine with superior graphics and different commentators and are dubbed \"next-generation\" by EA. On all other platforms—including the PC—the game utilizes an older engine. The Nintendo DS version features fewer teams, stadiums, game modes and kits due to the limitations of the machine\u0027s storage medium. \n \nCommentary comes from Sky Sports\u0027 Martin Tyler and Andy Gray on next generation consoles; however, ITV Sports\u0027 Clive Tyldesley partners Gray on current generation consoles, and the PC version of the game.

There are also changes to how the defensive line is formed, as well as improvements to crosses, freekicks and goalkeepers (who can now receive red cards). \n \nNaturally the game retains its hugely successful on and offline multiplayer modes, with new options and better stability for online play.

    "summary": "Final Fight is a side-scrolling beat-\u0027em-up produced by Capcom. Final Fight can be played by up to two players simultaneously. Before the game begins, the player chooses between the three main characters: Haggar, Cody, and Guy. Each has his own fighting style and attributes. Health gauges are displayed for both player and enemy characters.\n\nThe controls for Final Fight consist of an eight-way joystick and two buttons for attacking and jumping respectively. Pressing the attack button repeatedly when attacking an enemy or multiple enemies will cause the player character to perform a combo. The final blow of the combo can be changed to a throw if the player moves the joystick in the opposite direction just before landing it. The player can also perform a jump attack. Pressing the attack and jump buttons simultaneously allows the player to perform a special attack that strikes all surrounding enemies, but will drain a small portion of the player\u0027s health.\n\nEnemies can be grabbed simply by walking into one of them. When an enemy is grabbed, the player can perform a grab attack by pressing the attack button or perform a throw by tilting the joystick left or right. A thrown enemy can be tossed at another for additional damage. Items such as weapons, health recovery items, and items awarding extra points can be picked up by standing over one and pressing the attack button. Weapons have limited uses and will disappear if the player is disarmed by an enemy too much or when the player moves to a new area.\n\nFinal Fight consists of six stages or \"rounds\", as well as two bonus rounds. Each round takes place in a different section of Metro City such as the Slums and the Subway, with most rounds featuring more than one level. At the end of each round the player will face a boss character unique to that round.",

    "summary": "Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims is a Playstation Mini game for PSP and Vita. \n \nFloating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims is exactly that, a 2D shooter built around the eponymous deity (controlled by the player) and his quest to protect eight pilgrims in their journey across perilous territories. \n \nYour own shots just knock their hats off, but getting hit by anything else will kill a pilgrim and send their spirit floating off with a sad little wail. This is bad not only because the pilgrims are a de facto health bar (losing them all ends the game) but powering up Cloud God depends on harvesting their love - juicy little hearts that pop up whenever you kill an enemy and increase in size as you blast more. \n \nYou must get all of the love (given form as hearts) that they release, which then makes you much more powerful than you already are. You increase in size, look more menacing, and your attacks are more powerful. The pilgrims get the most excited when they witness ambushing ghosts and ghouls get annihilated by you. When they are excited, they produce more love, meaning more power to you. \n \nHowever, you have to be very careful when shooting. You grow weaker with every shot, so try not to channel your inner war-freak and have a little restraint, for the good of both yourself and the pilgrims. You also lose some of your steam if you get hit by enemy forces. And sometimes, the situation calls to for you to sacrifice your mightiness and provide cover to the pilgrims from the enemy assault with your own self. \n \nThere are two types of attack: the normal shot (by pressing X), and the bomb shot (by pressing Circle). The direction of the normal shot depends on what direction you are pressing, so there is some strategy to what part of the screen you should be shooting from. Being too far from your pilgrims is very dangerous but allows you to cover more ground, while launching a full frontal assault can protect your pilgrims by absorbing all the incoming fire. You have to think through, in real time, what tactics you would like to employ. You can always get in the middle, then rush forward, then get to a safe distance; mix and match, and you got yourself going. \n \nThe bomb shot is used if you are above the enemy. But that’s not all, as some enemies can’t be killed with the bomb shot, only with the normal shot, and vice versa. There are also enemies where you have to inflict bomb shot damage first before switching to the normal shot to take them out. \n \nEnemies are varied, and they look good, even if they are vile and evil. There are boss fights, too, to keep you on your toes. The Cloud God\u0027s powers and the heart system mesh so well that any enemy can be destroyed in a blink - so they\u0027ve got to be deceptive, sneaky, and sometimes numerous. Paper lanterns send out an arcing flame on death, red-eyed foxes hide in the scenery, imps swoop to carry off unlucky pilgrims and bobbing doll heads send out swarms of kisses. Hands start clawing up from the ground, crows dive-bomb your crew, and demons with phallic noses launch them as languorous, looping rockets. The cheeky oriental stylings are gorgeous, transforming symbols into everything from freaky momiji to dick-nosed devils. \n \nAs this suggests, one of the reasons Floating Cloud God is such a pleasure to play is its visual inventiveness, which has room enough for everything from Wario tributes to what looks like a crying poo. This big lump of a thing, which is introduced in a level called The Saddest Enemy, explodes into gobbets of mini-poo that are very useful for building up a heart multiplier. Perhaps they\u0027re babies? That would explain the sadness. \n \nFloating Cloud God has bags more where that came from, and despite the Minis tag has plenty of room to breathe (there are seven worlds with 27 stages, including boss fights). And it keeps on surprising. The controls are simplicity itself: left stick to move, one button to shoot and one to bomb. But you soon realise the subtlety of how shooting affects movement and vice-versa, which fairly soon you\u0027re depending on against every enemy pattern. The pilgrims, too, are loosely tied to Cloud God during some sections, and learning how to manage their momentum is another little learning curve. \n \nThe final touch is a minor detail that ties up everything. The pilgrims\u0027 hats can be improved. There\u0027s no in-game benefit to this, beyond looking much more awesome, and it\u0027s done by completing stages without losing a single pilgrim. Obviously, if you start this process on the first level and never lose a pilgrim, the hats just keep getting better. \n \nSeems like such a small thing, doesn\u0027t it? Soon nothing but a perfect run will do. The restart option is accessible, knowing, and tempting. Every time a pilgrim fell, it was too much to take - I didn\u0027t see their tiny spirit float off to heaven so much as all my future headwear ambitions. And to be fair, by that point I had four dudes with top hats, two with octopus heads and two with space hero helmets. You can\u0027t be replacing any of them with Norman and his brown cap just because some demon gets a lucky shot in. \n \nThat\u0027s the best thing about Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims. You do want to save them, and not just because they represent \u0027health\u0027. The hats are a big part of it, but just as much is the sense of pride in being a badass god - harvesting power at the right moment to smash through oncoming waves, battling desperate rear-guard actions against hails of deadly kisses and throwing yourself in bodily as a last resort (which sometimes works!). The little yelp as a pilgrim goes down is a sharp reprimand, a blow to the daydreams of an all-conquering deity. \n \nThis description was compiled from the following reviews: \n \nhttp://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-04-19-floating-cloud-god-saves-the-pilgrims-review \n \nhttp://www.pspminis.com/8859/floating-cloud-god-saves-the-pilgrims-review-if-the-indication-of-a-good-game-is-a-lengthy-title-then-that-rule-applies-here/",

    "storyline": "There are two plots of Front Mission 3, and both revolve around Japanese wanzer test pilots Kazuki Takemura and Ryogo Kusama. Through a decision made early in the game, the player can play either the DHZ scenario or the USN scenario. The DHZ scenario stars Japanese scientist Aliciana \"Alisa\" Takemura, while the USN scenario revolves around scientist Emir \"Emma\" Klamsky.\n\nAlthough both scenarios have different characters and story scenarios, they both share a number of events and locations in the game. Due to its storytelling approach, it is not known which of the two scenarios is canonically related to Front Mission 5: Scars of the War. On October 31, Kazuki begins testing a new prototype wanzer at a Kirishima Heavy Industries test site near Okinawa. Upon completing the test, he is informed that some construction wanzers need to be taken to the JDF base in Yokosuka. Ryogo asks Kazuki if he can join him in delivering the wanzers. If the player chooses to go with him, they will play the USN scenario. If the player does not go with him, they will play the DHZ scenario.\n\nIn either case, Kazuki and Ryogo are eventually tasked to deliver the Kirishima prototypes to the Yokosuka base. As they ready the wanzers for delivery, an explosion leads Kazuki to attempt going inside the base itself. The two test pilots are eventually forced to leave the base. Realizing that his sister Alisa was recently transferred to the base, Kazuki and Ryogo eventually find themselves back inside the complex.",

The young student Kazuki Takemura works as a test pilot with Kirishima Industries, a production company of military battle wanzers (walking panzers), mechanized walking robots with movement similar to that of a human being. Kazuki has just finished testing the combat capabilities of the new Zeinslev prototype in the lab. Finishing his day\u0027s tasks he is asked by his best friend Ryogo to help with a company delivery to the Japanese Defense Force (JDF) military based. This simple choice determines where Kazuki is when strange things begin happening in Japan. A large explosion, a wanzer theft, his sister Alysia being hunted, rumors of a powerful weapon, and accusations of involvement by agents of both the OCU and the USN all make the situation more complicated. Kazuki is swept up in a plot of conflicting loyalties and attacked by various factions. He will need to recruit additional characters and wanzers in order to be victorious in battle and investigate leads to uncover what is going on.",

    "storyline": "Set halfway through Kratos\u0027 ten years servitude to the Gods, Chains of Olympus begins with Kratos being dispatched to the city of Attica to help defend it from the invading Persian army. Soon after his arrival, the Spartan spots a basilisk climbing over the city walls and gives chase. During his chase, Kratos confronts the Persian King inside the city and kills him. Taking the King\u0027s power to summon the Efreet, he then encounters the basilisk and kills it. After defeating the basilisk, he witnesses the sun fall from the sky, plunging the world in darkness. Following the dim remaining light on the horizon, Kratos fights his way through the city of Marathon, along the way encountering the black fog of Morpheus, which now covers the land in darkness.",
    "summary": "The game is set in Ancient Greece and loosely based on its mythology. The player controls Kratos, a Spartan warrior in the service of the Olympian Gods. Kratos is guided by the goddess Athena, who instructs him to find the Sun God Helios, as the Dream God Morpheus has caused the remaining gods to slumber in Helios\u0027 absence. With the power of the sun, Morpheus and Persephone, the Queen of the Underworld, with the aid of the Titan Atlas, intend to destroy the Pillar of the World and in turn Olympus. God of War: Chains of Olympus is chronologically the second chapter in the series, which focuses on vengeance as its central theme.",

Kratos attempts to stop Ares but is swept aside and scarred across his right eye by the violent Olympian. Ares prepares to kill the young Kratos for attacking him.

This contrasts starkly with the many fantasy elements of the game, such as characters possessing magical armlets that give the wearer special abilities, and the suggestion that King Henry VI of England was possessed by demons and used them to aid his armies in destroying France during the Hundred Years\u0027 War.",

    "summary": "Lets face it... sometimes, videogames can be a bit weird. For example, who ever thought to mix colour matching with time trial style rally racing? And then to decide it should graphically look like something involing alien pond snakes and cellular life? Makes no sense, right? We at PomPom pride ourselves in making as little sense as possible. Hence our decision to do all the above. The result is JellyPops. \n \n \nIt goes something like this: You control a strange snake creature, which resides in a strange pond in a strange world with some strange rules. The aim is to stay alive as long as possible. Staying alive drains your live force, so Snake needs to collect life force gems to keep it going. With time, life gems become more and more scarce, resulting in a desperate race to reach the next gem before its lights out. \n \n \nBetween Snake and the life force gems are a myriad of other beasties that require special attention. Coloured Jellies which boost your gems value when collected as part of a combo. Teethy fish things that try to blast you with plasma. Spikey rocks and walls. Bouncing spherical cells that can be controlled and used as battering rams. Each level with its own unique mechanics to understand and master. \n \nFeatures : \nAvailable on PSP minis \nEndless survival gameplay \n8 ponds to traverse \nFun, slippy slidey racing type gameplay \nBonus Spirit and Boost unlockables \nMedals awarded for achievements \nCustom music which dynamically chages with gameplay \nQuick playtime. The perfect game for filling 5 minutes.",

Performing ordinary attacks and Commands fills a gauge displayed above the command deck that, when certain requirements are fulfilled, activates a Command Style that changes the player\u0027s basic attack command with the \"Surge\" command, which racks up powerful combos depending on what Command Style is activated. Filling the gauge with certain requirements a second time causes the character to change into an even higher level Command Style, which replaces the \"Surge\" command with the more powerful \"Storm\" command.",

    "summary": "Lumines is a block-dropping game, that may seem at first to be similar to Columns and Tetris. A 2 x 2 square (an O tetromino) made of four smaller block pieces is dropped into the playing field, which may appear different as the player advances through levels or skins. The small blocks that comprise the larger blocks will be one of two different colors. The objective is to rotate and align the blocks in such a way as to create 2x2 squares of the same color, which may span multiple blocks and, indeed, share blocks. For example, if one should get a 2x3 area of matching blocks, the middle portion will \"share\" itself with both the left and right halves and create two 2x2 squares. After the \"timeline\", which is synchronized to the music, sweeps over the matching blocks, they disappear. When too many unmatched blocks pile up to the point where no more blocks may be dropped in the playing field, the game ends. \nWhen part of a falling block hits an obstruction, the unobstructed portion of the block will split off and continue to fall. More points are scored by creating the largest number of squares during one \"timeline\" sweep. Increasing score multipliers are earned by repeatedly clearing squares on consecutive timeline sweeps. Bonuses are also awarded by reducing all remaining tiles to one single color or for removing all non-active tiles from the screen altogether. \nOccasionally, a block falls with a special square of one of the two colors with a \"jewel\" in the center. This square, when cleared as part of a matched 2x2 square, will cause all individual blocks of the same color that are horizontally or vertically adjacent to the matched 2x2 square, or to an adjacent square, to be cleared without score. These can be used for both generating large bonuses, since generally several blocks of the other color will be formed once these are removed, as well as to help the player recover if the field becomes too cluttered.",

With Althena gone and no one able or willing to become the next Dragonmaster, a shadowy figure, known only as the Magic Emperor, has started plotting to usurp Althena\u0027s place and become a god. In a remote village far removed from the decay that is slowly spreading throughout the world lives a young man named Alex, who dreams of one day becoming the next Dragonmaster like his hero Dyne. One day, Alex\u0027s friend Ramus convinces him to head towards a cave near town, where it is rumored the legendary White Dragon resides. With Alex\u0027s adopted sister Luna and his mysterious pet Nall in tow, Alex heads off on what seems to be a meaningless adventure, not knowing that it would be the first step in an epic journey with the fate of the entire world at stake.",

They are soon joined by Pamela (the school\u0027s resident ghost), Anna (an 11-year-old master swordsman), Roxis (the son of a famous family of alchemists who is quickly forced to join the workshop by Flay), and Muppy (an alien the group discovers on an assignment).

    "storyline": "Unlike Mega Man Powered Up, Maverick Hunter X is a reboot to the X series that has many changes to the story that completely disconnect it to the original timeline. It was the intention of Keiji Inafune to completely redo the first six games of the Mega Man X series, but this project was discontinued due to poor sales of Maverick Hunter X. \n \nThese are some examples of the continuity with the rest of the series being ignored: \n \nDr. Cain discovered X many years ago (as opposed to months), and is artificially extending his life via mechanical support to oversee the Reploids. He also fears he does not have long to live. Towards the end of The Day of Sigma, a missile also destroys his home in Abel City - with him inside it (although it is left ambiguous as to whether Cain had actually died or not). \n \nVile\u0027s story, barring his flashback to Sigma\u0027s release of him from his cell, is merely considered a \"what-if\" scenario, as it conflicts with X\u0027s game. However, the line by Sigma to \"retrieve Vile\" seems to foreshadow his remodel in Mega Man X3. \n \nDr. Light\u0027s reasons for sealing X are completely different from the version previously established. In the original storyline, Dr. Light sealed X in a special capsule that would basically test his moral integrity, because it would be necessary to determine whether X would ultimately make the right decisions when he entered the world. However, in Maverick Hunter X, Dr. Light is already confident with X\u0027s moral integrity, but seals him up because he believes mankind is not ready for him just yet. \n \nSigma\u0027s personality is depicted quite differently than in other games. Here, he is obsessed with the evolution of Reploids (which somewhat reflects his attitude in Mega Man X8), and is fascinated with X\u0027s potential rather than truly wishing to overcome the humans. He even directly states to Vile he plans to go Maverick to test X\u0027s abilities and bring out his true power, and instructs Vile to help him incite rebellion to help achieve this. As such, he also seemed to have gone Maverick of his own free will, although his statement when releasing Vile that he \"needed someone who could go Maverick of [his] own accord\" in the opening to Vile Mode implies that this might not necessarily be the case. \n \nOn a similar note, his interactions with X before the final battle are slightly different from the original, where he had been expecting Zero to arrive and was slightly annoyed that he was about to face X instead before ultimately realizing upon Velguarder\u0027s defeat that Zero may have chosen X to fight Sigma for a reason, while in the remake he was shown to be genuinely expecting X to arrive and hoping he did in fact meet the qualifications to face him.",

Wily discovered a prototype robot made by Doctor Light before Rock and Roll called Proto Man, who is in danger of having his energy generator go critical. Wily gave him a nuclear energy supply to extend his life. He later steals and reprograms the eight industrial robots to attempt world domination. Rock volunteered to stop Wily and rescue his friends, and Dr. Light converted him into a fighting robot, giving him a new name: Mega Man. After defeating all eight Robot Masters and returning them to normal, Mega Man goes through Dr. Wily\u0027s fortress and challenges him. After beating Wily, the mad scientist surrenders and asks Mega Man to spare him. Mega Man then returns home, where he\u0027s greeted by Dr. Light, Roll, and his friends.",

    "summary": "METAL GEAR AC!D, is a turn-based collectible card, It was the first game in the Metal Gear series for the PSP. A Java ME version for mobile phones was released by Glu Mobile in 2008 titled Metal Gear Acid Mobile. \n \nAcid focuses on turn-based tactics, using a trading card-based system to control the main character\u0027s movements and actions. Acid in the name stands for \"Active Command Intelligence Duel\". The cards are not truly collectible, as the game is complete with a single purchase. However, the game does feature deck design and deck optimization elements. The game allows for multiplayer gameplay by wireless ad-hoc connections of two PSPs. \n \nBefore each round, the player can customize the deck of cards used by the main characters. The majority of the cards are based upon elements spanning the entire Metal Gear series, such as weaponry, characters, and even the Metal Gear itself. When the game is started, the player\u0027s hand can consist of a maximum of six cards. The maximum number of cards in a deck increases with overall progress. In action mode, the player can choose to use the cards as they are intended or use them to move the character. Most cards only allow the player to move three spaces, while certain cards let the player move up to six or higher. \n \nCost is an important factor in game play and can be summed up as the weight of the player\u0027s action. With some exceptions, all cards have a cost attached to them and when used this cost transfers to the player. Cost varies radically from card to card. The higher the cost a character has, the longer that character must wait until their next turn. For example: if a player character has a cost of 15 and a guard has a cost of 10, then the guard\u0027s turn would occur before the character\u0027s. \n \nSome cards can be equipped; cards such as weapon cards, can have other cards attached to them in order to improve performance. In order to fire the weapon, another weapon card that uses the same kind of ammunition must be equipped. Some weapons don\u0027t need to be equipped and can be used by themselves, however they are discarded afterwards. Other cards that can be equipped include equipment cards and action cards. \n \nMultiplayer, or \"Link Battle\", is also a new feature. Two PSP systems running Acid can link wirelessly, allowing players to face each other in a \"sneak-off\". The objective is to collect a certain number of diskettes before the rival player. Diskettes can be stolen by another player, so there is an emphasis on avoiding detection.",

    "storyline": "Four years after the events of the San Hieronymo incident, Big Boss—who prefers his original title, Snake—and Kaz Miller have established Militaires Sans Frontières, a small mercenary faction, on the Colombian coast. They are approached by Ramon Galvez Mena, a professor at the University of Peace, and his student, Paz Ortega Andrade. Galvez attempts to hire MSF to investigate an army that has discreetly occupied parts of Costa Rica. Snake refuses, identifying Galvez as a KGB agent, but is convinced when Paz plays a recording of The Boss. \n \nWhen Snake arrives in Costa Rica, he begins to suspect that the mystery army has brought nuclear weapons with them. Enlisting the help of the Sandinista Liberation Army, he tracks a shipment to a research facility deep in the mountains. His suspicions are confirmed when he witnesses Hot Coldman, a senior CIA agent, announce his intentions to fire a live nuclear weapon as part of a project code-named \"Peace Walker,\" a fail-deadly nuclear tank. Snake reveals himself to Huey Emmerich, one of Peace Walker\u0027s designers, who agrees to help him stop Coldman. \n \nFollowing Huey\u0027s instructions, Snake ventures deeper into Costa Rica, searching for Dr. Strangelove, the designer of Peace Walker\u0027s artificial intelligence systems. He discovers that Strangelove has based Peace Walker\u0027s primary control systems on The Boss\u0027 personality. She demands to know whether The Boss genuinely defected to the Soviet Union, or if she died on a mission that was covered up, going so far as to torture Snake for information. \n \nSnake escapes custody and attempts in vain to destroy Peace Walker, a quadrupedal nuclear launch platform. He chases Peace Walker across the Nicaraguan border to an American airbase on the shores of Lake Cocibolca. Discovering that the base has been occupied by Soviet soldiers, Snake infiltrates the facility to confront Coldman. Coldman reveals the purpose of Peace Walker: he believes that nuclear deterrence is a flawed theory, relying on humans to retaliate in the event of a nuclear exchange, whom he believes to be unwilling to destroy their own race. As an impartial artificial intelligence, Peace Walker would guarantee retaliation, and Coldman intends to fire a warhead to prove it. Suddenly, the facility is overrun by Soviet soldiers, led by Galvez, who reveals himself as Vladimir Zadornov. Zadornov intends to hijack Peace Walker for the Soviet Union, but the standoff is broken by the arrival of MSF and the Sandinistas, giving Snake enough time to destroy Peace Walker. \n \nIn the aftermath of the battle, Zadornov is captured and Coldman mortally wounded. In his dying moments, Coldman activates Peace Walker\u0027s data uplink, convincing NORAD that the United States is about to be hit by a Soviet nuclear strike. Snake contacts NORAD, and tries to convince them to stand down, but senior members of the armed forces refuse and plan to retaliate. With a nuclear strike imminent, The Boss\u0027 personality takes control of Peace Walker\u0027s damaged artificial intelligence and drowns Peace Walker in Lake Cocibolca, severing the connection and ending the threat. \n \nSome time later, Zadornov repeatedly escapes from MSF, arousing Snake\u0027s suspicions that someone has betrayed them. Paz reveals herself to be the traitor, using Zadornov\u0027s escapes to seize control of Metal Gear ZEKE, a walking tank designed by Huey to act as MSF\u0027s deterrent against foreign intervention. Acting as an agent of Major Zero—now using the name \"Cipher\"—Paz issues Snake an ultimatum: surrender MSF to Cipher and become his deterrent, or else she will fire a nuclear warhead on America, at which point they will be branded a nuclear-equipped extremist cult, and the world will unite in their pursuit of MSF. Snake prevents the launch by crippling ZEKE, and Paz is thrown into the ocean. In the aftermath, Snake reconciles with his memory of The Boss and accepts the title of Big Boss as he rallies the soldiers of MSF to prepare for a fight for their survival, declaring them to be living in \"Outer Heaven\".",
    "summary": "MGS: Peace Walker is an action-adventure stealth video game and is the third action-based Metal Gear title made specifically for the PSP, following Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops and its stand-alone expansion Portable Ops Plus, and the first in the series released for a portable platform to be directed by series\u0027 creator Hideo Kojima. This is the first title in the series to alter the traditional tagline \"Tactical Espionage Action\" to \"Tactical Espionage Operations\", referring to the base building and mission mechanics of the game. \n \nSet in 1974 in Costa Rica, the game follows the exploits of returning protagonist Big Boss (previously known as Naked Snake in Snake Eater and Portable Ops, now known simply as Snake) as he runs the mercenary unit Militaires Sans Frontières (Soldiers Without Borders). \n \nPeace Walker consists of two primary playing modes: \"Mission\" and \"Mother Base\". \"Mission\" are the actual action sequences of the game, where the player must infiltrate an enemy territory, whereas \"Mother Base\" is a crew managing simulation mode similar to the \"Comrade System\" in Portable Ops. \n \nMissions \nPlayers get to choose which missions to play from the \"Mission Selector\" screen. There are two main types of Missions: Main Ops are the primary story-based missions in which goals are determined by the narrative and must be played in a strict order in order to proceed. Some Main Ops missions include illustrated cutscenes that involve bits of interactivity in order to proceed. Extra Ops are optional side-missions that involve much more elaborate goals ranging from simple target practices to obtaining secret documents. \n \nWhen the player completes a mission, his or her performance is evaluated afterward. A player\u0027s score is penalized with a lower rank and reduced heroism for excessive killing and frequently being discovered, whereas players who are stealthy and subdue enemy soldiers non-lethally will be awarded appropriately. Players can replay previously cleared missions for higher ranks. \n \nPlayers can go through missions as Snake or as an MSF soldier (male or female). Some missions will only be available to Snake, and likewise for MSF soldiers. \n \nThe game adopts certain mechanics from Metal Gear Solid 4, such as the ability to move while crouched, the over-the-shoulder shooting view, the CQC system, and the ability to search held-up soldiers. The truck from Portable Ops, where players can bring subdued enemies for recruitment, has been discarded in favor of the Fulton Recovery System, which players attach to subdued soldiers and prisoners. The Wi-Fi recruitment system from Portable Ops has been modified so that instead of tapping the Circle button to obtain a strong enough signal from an access point, the player will have to knockout soldiers using CQC to accept them. The cardboard box used to hide from enemy soldiers is now available in two-man versions called Love Boxes, which have different variants. The Surround Indicator in Portable Ops can also be used only when it is equipped in the item box and players will also develop and use an early version of the Soliton radar system from Metal Gear Solid. The game features the camouflage index system from Snake Eater, but the player does not have the ability to change camouflage uniforms during a mission as the point index will be entirely based on movement, position, and the size of the weapon equipped in the weapon box. The player can also use marking devices to call in artillery strikes or resupply drops. \n \nMovement is done on the analog stick; actions such as co-op actions use the directional-pad; melee actions, which include multiple throws into crowds of enemies, use the R button; and weapons use the L button with the R button. Players will be unable to move or shoot while lying down and while pinned on a wall. The player can set the control system according to that of Portable Ops, Guns of the Patriots, or Capcom\u0027s Monster Hunter. \n \nBefore starting a mission, the player can determine his or her character\u0027s item and weapon load-out, including the character\u0027s uniform. The player\u0027s carrying capacity is limited and any excessive items that the player obtains during a mission will be transferred over to Mother Base\u0027s inventory. There are four primary types of uniforms that can be worn by the player. \n \nJungle Fatigues — The default uniform for Snake and MSF Soldiers. A balance of stealth, defense, weapons, and inventory. Available in multiple camouflage patterns. \nNaked — A shirtless version of the Jungle Fatigues, players using Naked uniforms move fast at the cost of lower stealth, weaker defense, and fewer items. \nSneaking Suit — Resembles the sneaking suit worn by Snake in Snake Eater and Portable Ops, it allows players to move without generating foot noises and have higher camouflage compared to other suits while moving, but restricts them to five items and six secondary weapons. \nBattle Dress — A heavily armored suit that allows the player to carry a third primary weapon and absorb heavy firepower, but at the cost of a lower item carrying capacity, slower mobility and a lower camouflage index. A variant outfitted with a helmet is also available, which increases the defenses. \n \nMother Base \nThe Mother Base is an abandoned OTEC research platform in the Caribbean that serves as the MSF\u0027s headquarters. Aside from managing the combat, medical, intelligence, and technology research teams seen in MPO, the player can assign personnel to the mess hall crew to feed the troops and keep up their morale. Rebellious or injured personnel can be brought to the brig and sickbay, respectively. The player will also have a chance to capture military vehicles that appear in the game as minor boss opponents, such as armored personnel carriers, tanks, and attack helicopters. Up to 350 soldiers can be recruited; excess staff caught in a mission must be discharged and up to 50 vehicles can be captured over the course of the game. \n \nItems and weapons are not procured on-site, but rather they\u0027re developed by MSF\u0027s R\u0026D division based on blueprints obtained from missions. New items and weapons can only be developed when the player has sufficient GMP and certain MSF divisions have both reached the required level. Once development of an item has been completed, the R\u0026D staff will automatically mass-produce them for the entire army. \n \nOuter Ops is a new game mechanic where players can deploy their combat unit soldiers (with the exception of Snake and other unique characters) and captured vehicles on certain missions against computer opponents. Each assault force codenamed from Alpha to Hotel has eight slots for assigning vehicles or soldiers, who can gain combat bonuses such as additional hit points and Psyche points, and generate income for the team. Depending on the scale of the enemy\u0027s firepower, MSF soldiers who are defeated during the battle can either die or be brought to sickbay for treatment. Vehicles that show damage in one mission will still show damage unless they are taken off the front for repairs, while decommissioned vehicles will be stricken from the inventory. \n \nMultiplayer \nThe Comrade System from Portable Ops has been removed in favor of a cooperative play mode called \"Co-Ops\", which allows two players to play most sneaking missions and four players in boss missions. There are several actions that can take place when two players are next to each other. \u0027Snake-in\u0027 allows players to hold on to each other as one player leads the way, also allowing the players to fire on the move. Other co-operative actions include holding up closing doors, performing CPR on fallen comrades, sharing items, and acting as a spotter for other players whose vision is obscured. \n \nVersus Ops are multiplayer matches played over special versions of certain maps. The player has a choice of whether to organize individual or team deathmatches, base capture and quetzal capture missions. Only certain items or weapons unlocked in the single-player campaign can be used in the mode. Each match can gather up to six players with restrictions included, such as life and psyche points not regained and limited time for CPR revivals.",

It follows the soldier Naked Snake (David Hayter/Akio Ōtsuka) who is forced to fight off his former unit, FOX, after they instigate a revolt in a South American base. In his fight he meets Roy Campbell (David Agranov/Toshio Furukawa), a surviving member of the Green Berets team that was sent to investigate the affair. Snake\u0027s former teammates including his commanding officer Major Zero (Jim Piddock/Banjō Ginga), Para-Medic (Heather Halley/Houko Kuwashima) and Sigint (James C. Mathis III/Keiji Fujiwara) return as the support crew as they are suspected for treason alongside Snake. \n \nThe main antagonist is Gene (Steven Blum/Norio Wakamoto), the current commander of the FOX unit who seeks to establish his own military nation. He is a product of the Successor Project that aimed to artificially create the perfect commander, patterned after The Boss. He is assisted by Lt. Cunningham (Noah Nelson/Daisuke Gōri), an expert in interrogation techniques. (who is later revealed to be a double agent of the Pentagon sent to tarnish the CIA\u0027s reputation) Gene also has a protégé named Elisa (Tara Strong/Saori Goto) who is gifted with extraordinary psychic abilities, implied to be the result of exposure to nuclear fallout during the Kyshtym disaster. Elisa suffers from dissociative identity disorder and has a developed a second personality called Ursula\u0027, whose psychic abilities are stronger than her \"Elisa\" personality. As \"Ursula\", she works as a member of FOX, while her \"Elisa\" personality is a medic who takes care of Null and an informant for Snake. Snake meets Elisa, who initially tells Snake that she and Ursula are twin sisters, only to later learn the truth. Two FOX members previously associated with Snake include Null (Larc Spies/Jun Fukuyama), a teenage assassin trained to be the perfect soldier. and Python (Dwight Schultz/Yusaku Yara), a former war buddy of Snake who was previously presumed dead during the Vietnam War. \n \nOther characters include Ghost (Brian Cummings/Naoki Tatsuta), an informant who comes into contact with Snake, revealing the existence of ICBMG, the new Metal Gear prototype, Ocelot (Josh Keaton/Takumi Yamazaki), a former Spetsnaz Major who assists Gene from behind-the-scenes, EVA (Vanessa Marshall/Misa Watanabe), a spy for the PLA who assisted Snake in Snake Eater and Raikov (Charlie Schlatter/Kenyu Horiuchi), a GRU Major. Teliko Friedman (Kari Wahlgren/Yūko Nagashima) and Venus (Kathryn Fiore/Rika Komatsu), the heroines from Metal Gear Acid and Metal Gear Acid 2 respectively, can both be added to the player\u0027s squad by either: completing certain side-missions or by starting the second playthrough with save data from their respective games.",

The product features former USC player Reggie Bush on the cover. While there weren\u0027t any stunning new features added to the PS2 and Xbox games, tweaks were added to improve the existing features.\n\nThe theme for 07 is \"Turn the Tide.\" Like the 2005 version said for home-field advantage, this year\u0027s version emphasizes that momentum is more important in college football than any other sport. This is illustrated by a momentum meter on the score graphic at the top (or bottom, in the case of the Xbox 360 version) of the screen. The more the meter is shifted towards a team, the better its players will perform (ex. If momentum bar is all the way full with a +5 number below it (or above it), all players on the team will have their attributes boosted 5 points).\n\nNCAA Football 07 also includes spring drills, an update to Race for the Heisman mode called Campus Legend (which plays more like NFL Superstar mode in Madden), ESPN integration, and a spring game in Dynasty and Campus Legend modes. ESPN integration is expected to increase with the next NCAA Football releases.",

It is a platformer with puzzle-solving elements, focusing on the portrayal of a weak, underpowered character in a grim and hostile world, who has to rely on his cunning to outwit enemies and overcome hazards. The game has pre-rendered background graphics and uses CG movies of similar style to advance the story between the levels.\n\nThe main character Abe is almost completely helpless: he cannot use weapons and is usually instantly killed by his brutal enemies if he confronts them directly. For this reason, most of the game involves careful exploration, timed movement, sneaking, and outsmarting the foes through various means: throwing stones to confuse them, luring them into traps, etc. Abe can run, jump, climb, tiptoe, crouch, and roll; in most areas these actions are essential to his survival. A few stages involve Abe riding a large animal known as Elum.\n\nAbe\u0027s only special power is chanting, which he can use to stun certain enemies for a while or possess them. When Abe possess an enemy he gains his abilities: for example, possessing the body or a ferocious Slig allows the player to shoot from his machine gun, communicate with other creatures of his kind, and even commit suicide, clearing the way for Abe.",

    "summary": "Phantom Brave is a strategy RPG which takes place in the world of Ivoire. Ivoire consists of vast seas and numerous islands; it used to be a peaceful place, but an ancient (and powerful) force is now threatening life in the various lands. The character you control in the game is Marona, a 13 year old orphaned girl. Marona has the ability to communicate with phantoms, an ability that brings a lot of resentment from other people but will help her to head out into the world and solve the problems that are occurring. A phantom known as Ash acts as Marona\u0027s guardian; as the game progresses, other phantoms will join your party, each of which have different capabilities.\n\nThe game features a turn based combat system. During battles, Marona is able to attack enemies by herself, and she can also summon phantoms in her party to help out. To summon phantoms, you will need to confine them to an object on the screen (such as a rock or tree). Once confined to an object, you will then be able to control the phantom in battle, though phantoms only remain controllable for a limited number of turns. The object you confine a phantom to will affect it\u0027s abilities; for example, a rock may make a phantom stronger but move slower. By defeating enemies in battle you earn experience points allowing to level up and become more powerful.",

Working closely with Williams to ensure authenticity of each of the games, the collection is highlighted by some of the most popular and innovative Williams pinball tables, including Gorgar, the first-ever talking pinball machine, Black Knight, which introduced \"Magna-Save\" and Bonus Ball, and Space Shuttle, which took the pinball industry by storm in 1984. Every table has been meticulously recreated to bring players the visuals, sound effects and gameplay that made these games legendary successes. Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection harkens back to the arcades of the 1980s. Players begin Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection with access to four pinball tables, and the remaining four tables are unlocked as the game progresses. Players can spend as little as two minutes on a quick pinball challenge, or delve deeper into the game, gaining rewards in a token-based system as they unlock each of the pinball tables. Single-player Arcade and Challenge modes provide hours of solo entertainment, and a Multiplayer mode lets players face each other head-on.",

The Prince seeks counsel from an old wise man who explains that whoever releases The Sands of Time must die. Because the Prince escaped his fate, it is the Dahaka\u0027s mission as guardian of the Timeline to ensure that he dies as he was meant to. The old man also tells of the Island of Time, where the Empress of Time first created the Sands. The Prince sets sail for the Island in an attempt to prevent the Sands from ever being created, an act he believes will appease the Dahaka. After a battle at sea with an enemy force led by a mysterious woman in black capsizes the Prince\u0027s ship, the Prince washes ashore unconsciously onto the Island of Time.\nHe later awakens and chases the woman in black through the Empress of Time\u0027s fortress into a portal that transports the two into the past. The Prince saves a woman named Kaileena from being killed by the woman in black, whose name is Shahdee. Unable to grant the Prince an audience with the Empress of Time, who is busy preparing to create the Sands, Kaileena instead tells him how to unlock the door to the throne room in which the Empress resides. The Prince makes his way through the fortress, utilizing the sand portals to travel back and forth between the past and present, and narrowly escapes several encounters with the Dahaka, who he discovers cannot pass through water. The Prince activates the mechanisms in the two towers of the fortress - the Garden Tower and the Mechanical Tower - that serve as locks to the door. He returns to the throne room only to discover that Kaileena is actually the Empress of Time herself, who has foreseen in the Timeline that the Prince will kill her and who has decided to attempt to defy her fate, just as the Prince is doing. A battle ensues and the Prince proves victorious; he kills Kaileena and returns to the present. What lies ahead is the most dramatic Twist in the Prince\u0027s life, and He starts believing the priest who told him \"You cant change your Fate! No Man Can..\" But Prince is not going to give up that easily.",
    "summary": "Prince of Persia: Warrior Within is a video game and sequel to Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Warrior Within was developed and published by Ubisoft, and released on December 2, 2004 for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Microsoft Windows. It picks up where The Sands of Time left off, adding new features, specifically, options in combat. The Prince now has the ability to wield two weapons at a time as well as the ability to steal his enemies\u0027 weapons and throw them. The Prince\u0027s repertoire of combat moves has been expanded into varying strings that allow players to attack enemies with more complexity than was possible in the previous game. Warrior Within has a darker tone than its predecessor adding in the ability for the Prince to dispatch his enemies with various finishing moves. In addition to the rewind, slow-down, and speed-up powers from The Sands of Time, the Prince also has a new sand power: a circular \"wave\" of sand that knocks down all surrounding enemies as well as damaging them. The dark tone, a vastly increased level of blood and violence as well as sexualized female NPCs earned the game an M ESRB rating.",

Lionel Messi is featured as the cover although Andres Guardado features on some versions. A new game mode called Become A Legend has been brought in which involves creating a player and taking him through a career. The Master League mode now has two-tier negotiations which involve negotiating with the club first and then the player separately. Also the edit mode was notably improved with badges and kits now being as intuitive as they were on PS2 versions.\n\nAlthough the game is generally viewed as an improvement, the Online Mode and the omission of players such as Danny Alves, Tomas Zapotocny and Walter Lopez drew plenty of criticism.\n\nThe game will be followed by PES 2010.",

PES 2014 will center everything on the ball: how it moves, and how players use it. Physics of the ball, stature of the player, speed and height of the pass, everything will be taken into account to recreate the most realistic football experience on a home system. Players will be an important part of the game with Motion Animation Stability System (M.A.S.S.), that will increase the realism of physical contacts between players, tackles and decisions taken on the pitch by the AI to have more open games. The audience will have an influence on the performance of the team. On the pitch, the performance of an individual player, good or bad, will also have an effect on the team, giving them a moral boost if he has a moment of individual brilliance; or forcing his teammates to support him if he is not doing well. \n\nIntroduced in PES 2013, the Player ID system recreated faithfully the movements and skills of about 50 star players. In PES 2014, that number is increased and will also apply to complete squads to replicate a team\u0027s playing style. With the new Combination Plan, users will be able set up a variety of different tactics in key areas of the pitch using three or more players. These players will make very different runs to exploit holes in the defense or midfield, using the flanks, curved runs, or overlapping play to make themselves available.\n\nNew for this year, players can now change teams in the Master League and coach a national side. Players are also able to create 3rd and 4th kits. Some third and fourth kits are official. The PS2 version has the same characteristics of the other versions. UEFA Europa League also appears as a single-mode.",

The game had a much slower pace than its predecessors which surprised and angered many PES fans but was welcomed by others who thought 4 was too fast.

The conflict eventually ground to a halt and an uneasy truce was reached, as neither nation had the resources to continue fighting. Even so, the animosity between the two parties never faded, but smoldered beneath the surface, always threatening to explode into flames. In the resulting tenuous peace, the people of the peninsula began to resume their normal lives, always aware that the war could resume at any time. \nIt was against this backdrop that the protagonist begins their fight against rival factions, hordes of ravening monsters controlled by enigmatic puppet masters, and even their own dark impulses...",

    "storyline": "On July 24, 1998, when a series of bizarre murders occur on the outskirts of the fictional Midwestern town of Raccoon City, the Raccoon City Police Department\u0027s S.T.A.R.S. team are assigned to investigate. After contact with Bravo Team is lost, Alpha Team is sent to investigate their disappearance. Alpha Team locates Bravo Team\u0027s crashed helicopter and land at the site, where they are suddenly attacked by a pack of monstrous dogs, killing team member Joseph Frost. After Alpha Team\u0027s helicopter pilot, Brad Vickers, panics and takes off alone, the remaining members of the team (Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, Albert Wesker and Barry Burton) are forced to seek refuge in a nearby abandoned mansion.\n\nDepending on which character the player assumes control of, either Chris or Barry are separated from the rest of the team during the chase and do not make it to the mansion. At this point, the team decides to split up to investigate. Over the course of the game, the player character may encounter several members of Bravo Team, including Enrico Marini, the captain of the S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team, who reveals that one of Alpha Team\u0027s members is a traitor before being shot and killed by an unseen assailant. The player character eventually learns that a series of illegal experiments were being undertaken by a clandestine research team under the authority and supervision of biomedical company Umbrella Corporation. The creatures roaming the mansion and its surrounding areas are the results of these experiments, which have exposed the mansion\u0027s personnel and various animals and insects to a highly contagious and mutagenic biological agent known as the T-virus.\n\nEventually, the player character discovers a secret underground laboratory containing Umbrella\u0027s experiments. In the lab, the player encounters Wesker, who reveals that he is a double agent working for Umbrella, and plans to use the Tyrant, a giant humanoid supersoldier, to kill the remaining S.T.A.R.S. members. However, in the ensuing confrontation, Wesker is supposedly killed and the player character defeats the Tyrant. After activating the lab\u0027s self-destruct system, the player character reaches the heliport and manages to contact Brad for extraction, at which point the player may be confronted by Tyrant one last time. The game features multiple endings depending on the player\u0027s actions at key points over the course of the game. In the best ending, the surviving team members escape by helicopter as the mansion self-destructs. In contrast, in the worst possible ending, the mansion remains intact and the player character is the sole survivor.",
    "summary": "An updated version, Resident Evil: Director\u0027s Cut, was released for PlayStation in September 1997, a year and a half after the original game. Director\u0027s Cut was produced to compensate for the highly publicized delay of the sequel, Resident Evil 2, and was originally bundled with a playable pre-release demo of that game. The Japanese version of the demo disc also included a pre-release demo of Rockman Neo, later retitled Rockman DASH (Mega Man Legends outside Japan), and a trailer for the newly released Breath of Fire III.\n\nThe main addition to Director\u0027s Cut is an \"arranged\" version of the game that changes the location of nearly every vital item in the mansion, as well as the enemy placement. The main characters, as well as Rebecca, are given a new wardrobe and the player\u0027s handgun is replaced by an improved model where any shot fired has a random chance of decapitating a zombie, killing it instantly. The original version of the game is included as well, along with a new \"beginner\" mode where the enemies are easier to kill and the amount of ammunition that can be found by the player is doubled. Additionally, the auto-aim function was restored in all modes, though it is not noted in the in-game controls.\n\nThe North American and European releases of the Director\u0027s Cut were marketed as featuring the original, uncensored footage from the Japanese releases. However, the full motion video (FMV) sequences were still censored, and Capcom claimed the omission was the result of a localization mistake made by the developers. The game\u0027s localization was handled by Capcom Japan instead of Capcom USA, and when submitted to Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA), it was rejected because of one line of copyright text. Rather than remove the individual line, Capcom Japan decided to save time and simply swap in the cinematics from the U.S. release of the original Resident Evil. SCEA then approved the game and manufactured a full production run without Capcom USA having any idea that the uncensored scenes had been cut. Three days after the game\u0027s release, the uncensored intro was offered as a free download from their website. The French and German PAL versions of Director\u0027s Cut do feature the uncensored intro FMV in color, though they lacked the uncensored Kenneth death scene. Although the PC version of Resident Evil was not billed as the director\u0027s cut version of the game, it is the only version of Resident Evil that has all of the uncensored FMVs, which includes the uncensored introduction, Kenneth\u0027s death scene in its entirety, and ending as well.",

Vehicles use one of two styles of powersliding depending on the make of car they select: Drift and Grip. Drift cars require players to tap the brake once while turning to break into a smooth powerslide while Grip cars requires players to alternate between brakes and gas while turning to powerslide.\nVehicles are earned by playing through the game\u0027s Grand Prix mode. Players select one of four teams; R.C Micro Mouse Mappy, Pac Racing Club, Racing Team Solvalou and Dig Racing Team, who each have varying difficulties, and one of four manufacturers; Age Solo, Lizard, Assoluto and Terrazi, which determines the style of car and powerslide type the player will use. In each race, the player must attempt to reach a qualifying position, with later stages requiring players to place in higher positions to qualify. Depending on the qualifying position in each race, players will be awarded a new vehicle, or an upgrade to their current one, based on their team and manufacturer, with better cars earned for reaching consistently higher positions (i.e. the best cars are earned by placing 1st in each match while the least impressive cars are earned by just clearing the minimum qualifying positions). There are a total of 320 vehicles earned by racing with every combination of team, manufacturer and qualifying position. If the players unlock all 320 cars, they will unlock an additional one modelled after Pac-Man, for a total of 321 vehicles.\nThe game also features Time Attack mode, in which players can attempt to get the fastest time on each course, and VS. Battle, a split-screen mode for two players (the first to appear in the home console series) and an undocumented PlayStation Link Cable mode, allowing four players to play simultaneously. Players can also create them our car decors and participate in Extra Trials against powerful prototype cars. The game is also compatible with the JogCon peripheral and the PocketStation device, which allows players to trade cars with friends.\nA further new feature was the Decal Edit, which allowed players to design their own logo for use on cars.",

It\u0027s therefore important to find the best setup for the bike changing suspension setup, handling geometry, braking, chainring length, gear ratio and tire type.",

To Makoto\u0027s surprise, Sekai gives him her full and enthusiastic support. Her encouragment brings fresh color to his dull, uneventful life.\n\nFrom the moment she drags the two of them to their first lunch together, the barriers between Makoto and Kotonoha begin to fall. Sekai, however, grows increasingly distracted, as if lost in her own thoughts.\nOn the platform at dusk, Makoto waits for Kotonoha to arrive for their first date.\nSekai passes by on the way home from school.\n\nGrateful for her part in bringing him and Kotonoha together, Makoto promises to do anything he can to thank her.\n\nA moment later, Makoto stands there on the platform, stunned.\n\nOn the train, Sekai clasps her phone, a picture of Makoto set within.\n\nKotonoha hurries towards the station, a cheerful smile on her face.\n\nAnd so, as three hearts burn with three different emotions, the story begins.",

It was later ported to PSP in 2005.\n\nAbandoning the post-apocalyptic themes of the original series, the story takes place in modern Japan. The player character is an unnamed college student who is attacked by demons along with his girlfriend; they are saved by the timely appearance of a suave demon-hunter named Kyouji. Shortly thereafter, Kyouji is found dead under suspicious circumstances. The protagonist is then trapped inside of a warehouse and murdered by a deranged killer named Sid. Rather than stay dead, the player finds himself in the reanimated body of the slain Kyouji, and escapes from the morgue. With the help of Kyouji\u0027s voice, which guides the player from inside his head, the main character joins up with Kyouji\u0027s female partner Rei in order to save the life of his girlfriend, who is still in danger.",

    "summary": "A sequel to Street Fighter, Street Fighter II improved upon the many concepts introduced in the first game, including the use of command-based special moves and a six-button configuration, while offering players a selection of multiple playable characters, each with their own unique fighting style and special moves.\n\nStreet Fighter II is credited for starting the fighting game boom during the 1990s. Its success led to the production of several updated versions, each offering additional features and characters over previous versions, as well as many home versions. Some of the home versions of the Street Fighter II games have sold millions of copies, with the SNES port of the first Street Fighter II being Capcom\u0027s best-selling consumer game of all-time as of 2008.\n\nStreet Fighter II follows several of the conventions and rules already established by its original 1987 predecessor. The player engages opponents in one-on-one close quarter combat in a series of best-two-out-of-three matches. The objective of each round is to deplete the opponent\u0027s vitality before the timer runs out. If both opponents knock each other out at the same time or the timer runs out with both fighters having an equal amount of vitality left, a \"double KO\" or \"draw game\" is declared and additional rounds will be played until sudden death. In the first Street Fighter II, a match could last up to ten rounds if there was no clear winner; this was reduced to four rounds in Champion Edition and onward. If there is no clear winner by the end of the final round, then either the computer-controlled opponent will win by default in a single-player match or both fighters will lose in a 2-player match.\n\nAfter every third match in the single player mode, the player will participate in a \"bonus game\" for additional points. The bonus games includes (in order) a car-breaking event; a barrel breaking bonus game where the barrels are dropped off from a conveyor belt above the player; and a drum-breaking bonus game where drums are flammable and piled over each other. The bonus games were removed from the arcade version of Super Street Fighter II Turbo.\n\nLike in the original, the game\u0027s controls uses a configuration of an eight-directional joystick and six attack buttons. The player uses the joystick to jump, crouch and move the character towards or away from the opponent, as well as to guard the character from an opponent\u0027s attacks. There are three punch buttons and three kick buttons of differing strength and speed (Light, Medium and Heavy). The player can perform a variety of basic moves in any position, including grabbing/throwing attacks, which were not featured in the original Street Fighter. Like in the original, the player can perform special moves by inputting a combination of directional and button-based commands.\n\nStreet Fighter II differs from the original due to the selection of multiple playable characters, each with their distinct fighting styles and special moves. Additionally, the player can also \"cancel\" during animation by performing another move, allowing for a combination of several basic and special moves. Both of these features would be expanded upon in subsequent installments.",

    "storyline": "Gabriel Logan and Lian Xing are operatives of The Agency, on the trail of Erich Rhoemer, an international terrorist. In August of 1999, Agent Ellis attempted to infiltrate Rhoemer\u0027s narcotics operation in Guácimo, Costa Rica, but was discovered and executed by ex-KGB agent Mara Aramov. Rhoemer then ordered Anton Girdeux, a French mercenary, to burn down the plantation to hide the evidence of their Syphon Filter research.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Edward Benton, the Agency Deputy Director, is briefing Logan\u0027s mission to Agency Director Thomas Markinson and a shadowy, unnamed figure. Several weeks later, Gabe and Lian investigate a mysterious viral outbreak in the Himalayas, which leaves only a single survivor. (Lian describes this as impossible.)\n\nThe game begins one month after the events in Costa Rica. Rhoemer and his terrorists have launched an assault on Washington, D.C. Gabe defeats Pavel Kravitch, Rhoemer\u0027s communications expert, which allows him to gain entry to the Washington Metro. Once inside, an explosive goes off leaving Gabe trapped underground. He pursues Aramov, catching her in the tunnels before heading to a nearby park to aid in the defusing of several viral bombs, where he learns that Aramov has escaped custody. Making his way to the Freedom Memorial, Gabe takes on and defeats Jorge Marcos, Rhoemer\u0027s trigger man, before he incinerates Girdeaux.\n\nLab results show that Syphon Filter is a deadly next-generation biological weapon, capable of targeting specific demographics. Jonathan Phagan, PHARCOM\u0027s CEO and founder, attends a gala at his new Expo Center Museum in New York City, where he is taken captive by Aramov and Benton is revealed as a double agent. Gabe kills Benton and frees Phagan, but Aramov, who is captured, again escapes custody.\n\nGabe goes to Rhoemer\u0027s secret base in Rozova, Kazakhstan. He kills Rhoemer\u0027s commander Vladislav Gabrek and destroys the base, but Lian is taken captive and presumably killed by Rhoemer.\n\nGabe is then sent to infiltrate Rhoemer\u0027s stronghold in Uzhhorod, Ukraine, which is an abandoned cathedral. Injecting viral patients with what he is convinced is an antidote, Gabe descends deeper into the cathedral to rescue Lian; who explains that there is no \u0027global\u0027 antidote for the virus. They also find Phagan, who is later killed by Aramov. She decides to help Gabe and Lian, since she has nowhere else to go.\n\nGabe then infiltrates the PHARCOM warehouses in Almaty, Kazakhstan, where PHARCOM security is battling Rhoemer\u0027s men. Gabe learns that Markinson, who had been secretly negotiating with Rhoemer to obtain Syphon Filter for the Agency, had made Gabe inject the patients with potassium chloride. Rhoemer reveals he has captured a Soviet-era nuclear ICBM. Rhoemer shoots Markinson and starts the launch sequence for the missile. Gabe cannot prevent it from launching, so his only hope is to initiate its self-destruct sequence once it is in the upper atmosphere. Gabe successfully destroys the missile. Rhoemer, furious at Logan\u0027s interference, engages him in a final showdown. Gabe is able to kill him and avert World War III.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, the shadowy figure from the beginning of the game is holding a sample of Syphon Filter inside the Agency\u0027s headquarters with Aramov, who is laughing.",

Dorgalua then claimed the throne as his own, and was able to end the struggle between the ethnic groups. Under King Dorgalua, the rights of the people were preserved, and all internal struggles in Valeria came to a temporary halt.\nAll is right until the entire royal family is lost due to a string of accidents. Because the late King Dorgalua had no living heirs, the ethnic groups once again struggled for leadership: Abuna Brantyn of the royal court, Heirophant Balbatos of the Galgastani, and Duke Ronwey of the Walister all fought for control, but in the end, Balbatos and Brantyn stalemated. In order to preserve their power, the two men took separate measures: Heirophant Balbatos sought an \"ethnic cleansing\" policy and slaughtered thousands of innocent Walister and Galgastani, while Brantyn received aid from foreigners, the Dark Knights Loslorien of the Holy Lodis Empire.\nDenam Pavel is the primary protagonist in Tactics Ogre. He is the son of Abuna Prancet, and after Prancet was taken away by the Dark Knights and his home town was massacred, Denam, his sister Catiua, and his friend Vyce plan a vendetta against the Dark Knights.

    "storyline": "A worldwide martial arts tournament was nearing its finale. A large purse of prize money which was to be awarded to the fighter who could defeat Heihachi Mishima in the final round provided incentive for warriors from all over the globe.\n\nFinanced and sponsored by the giant financial groups, the Mishima Zaibatsu, the first Tekken tournament began with eight fighters, all of whom had emerged victorious in death matches held all over the world, all motivated by different motives, all possessing the skill and power to crumble mountains.\n\nMany battles were fought. But only one lone warrior emerged with the right to challenge Heihachi Mishima for the title of King of the Iron Fist.\n\nThis warrior was Kazuya Mishima, Heihachi\u0027s cold blooded son. Bearing the scar given to him by Heihachi, he enters into vicious combat with his father on the same field where Heihachi last struck down his own son and dropped him into a trench at age five.\n\nAfter a grueling battle which raged on for hours, Kazuya emerged victorious by utilizing the skills which had been passed down from generation to generation of the Mishima clan.\n\nAs Heihachi\u0027s broken body lay on the ground, Kazuya dropped to his knees and slowly lifted his father into his arms. Walked slowly to the edge of the same cliff where his father had left him to die, stared out over the landscape of all that was now his, and let go of his father\u0027s body. As Heihachi\u0027s body plummeted, Kazuya\u0027s smile gleamed in the sunlight...\n\nOne year has passed. The Mishima Zaibatsu under Kazuya\u0027s leadership has become even more powerful with its tendrils reaching to all corners of the world. Soon after his father\u0027s apparent death, Kazuya disappears into the shadows. However, rumors of his immense power, and a dark side, slowly begin to spread throughout the world.\n\nExactly two years after the first Tekken tournament, a message is relayed from the Mishima Zaibatsu fortress to news agencies all over the world announcing a second tournament with a prize a thousand times that of the first.\n\nSo the tournament begins...",

When the dust settles, Jin is victorious. Disgusted, Heihachi Mishima turns his back on Kazuya.\n\n\"Was that the best you could do? Pathetic! You deserve to die.\"\n\nA duel ensues between Heihachi and Jin... Jin sprouts black wings and goes berserk with rage, proving to be more than a match for Heihachi. Jin, however, regains his senses just before dealing the lethal blow.\n\n\"Be thankful for Jun Kazama...my mother.\"\n\nSaying this, he flies off, leaving Honmaru behind. Heihachi is drained and defeated and lies sprawled on the ground. Once again, the battleground is silent.\n\nHowever, the silence is short-lived. Soon the sound of an aircraft can be heard approaching. The buzz grows to a roar, and something can be heard launching from the craft. A hoard of Jacks suddenly burst through the ceiling, invading the compound.\n\nAt first Heihachi thinks that Kazuya has orchestrated the invasion. Kazuya, however, is roused by the rumbling and shaking, and obviously doesn\u0027t know what is going on either.\n\n\"Who are you?!\"\n\nJust as Heihachi shouts, the Jacks attack both of them. Heihachi and Kazuya are forced to fight together and begin destroying the Jacks. However, for every Jack they wreck, two more seem to take its place. Just as Heihachi begins to show signs of fatigue, Kazuya betrays him, hurling him into the midst of their enemies.\n\n\"Nnnoooooooo!!! Kazuyaaaaaa!!!\"\n\nIgnoring Heihachi\u0027s screams, Kazuya escapes Hon-maru while the enemies are distracted. Immediately afterward, Honmaru erupts in a massive explosion and is annihilated. A man cloaked in black silently watches the explosion.\n\nPlacing his hand on his ear, he checks his transmission signal and reports: \"Heihachi Mishima is dead...\"\n\nImmediately after his transmission, a single Jack attacks him from behind, but is obliterated with a single stroke of the man\u0027s blade.\n\nWith that, the man vanishes.\n\nDesolated and in flames, all traces of Hon-maru have been destroyed. No one remains to witness the creature that bursts out of the ground amidst the rubble.\n\nThe following day the world learns of the death of Heihachi Mishima, leader of the Mishima Zaibatsu. This should have marked the end of the Mishima Zaibatsu, but a mysterious figure assumes leadership of the organization, restoring order to it as if nothing has occurred.\n\nOne month passes...\n\nMishima Zaibatsu announces it will host The King of Iron Fist Tournament 5.\n\nThe mysterious King of Iron Fist Tournament is about to begin once more...",

Most of the population remains unaware of their abuses of power, but to the most enigmatic order of the beloved Septian Church, the Gralsritter, snuffing out these would-be villains and claiming artifacts in their name is as everyday as professing one’s faith in the Goddess.\n\nOn the eve of another successfully completed mission, high-ranking member Father Kevin Graham is immediately assigned to retrieve one more artifact that rests beneath Grancel Cathedral. What’s more, even though this is a task he could easily complete on his own, he must reluctantly do so in partnership with his newest recruit, rookie Gralsritter and childhood friend Sister Ries Argent.\n\nThus begins the start of a routine mission that becomes anything but, delving into a new and mysterious realm that follows an unnaturally strict set of rules: Phantasma. Therein, the history of the Septian Church and the pasts of the many familiar faces who took up arms for the sake of Liberl’s future will be laid bare…and some may have been better off staying forever sealed behind closed doors.\"",

    "storyline": "The game starts at the neighborhood level. Here you can create a housing development from scratch or start with one of three pre-made neighborhoods, each with its own theme. From there, you\u0027ll settle on a house and a family of Sims to control. Sims now have aspirations, wants, and fears. The wants and fears are the day-to-day things that occupy their minds, like wanting to see friends or get married and fearing death or being rejected for a kiss. Satisfy their wants, and they become more efficient at completing tasks you assign them. Realize their fears, and Sims become lethargic, cranky, and unresponsive to your commands. Aspirations are the big-picture things, like raising a family, becoming wealthy, and gaining knowledge. Succeed here and you\u0027ll be able to buy odd gifts for your Sim to improve his or her life, like a money tree that pays dividends or a \"fountain of youth\" water cooler.\n\nOf course, you wouldn\u0027t be able to juggle all that if it weren\u0027t for the improved \"Free Will\" option, which makes it easier for Sims to fulfill their basic needs. The artificial intelligence of the game is noticeably improved; they won\u0027t turn on radios just as a family member is going to bed but, strangely, they do occasionally put their dishes on the floor.\n\nAnother big change in the series is the concept of the lifespan. Now Sims are born with the traits of their parents, families grow, and Sims grow old. Not only does this go hand in hand with aspirations (growing up is the first aspiration that a baby Sim will have), it provides a limited time with which your Sims can achieve their goals.\n\nThe pre-made households all have backstories that are smart spoofs of soap-opera plots--lots of scheming, romance, ghosts, and family fighting.",

You\u0027ll be able to control your Sims over their entire lifetimes, taking them from their first steps to their golden years. Guide them through \"Life\u0027s Big Moments\" and build their \"Life Score\" with every decision you make. And since every Sim will have its own DNA, their appearance and personality will be passed down through the generations. Life in The Sims 2 will take on a whole different dimension with an entirely new 3-D engine.",

The putt preview has been improved, allowing the player to simulate the ball\u0027s path once per individual spot, taking into accounts elements such as power, speed and elevation. On the Xbox 360 and the PS3, shots are not performed using the analog stick, but with the 3-point timed principle for start, power and accuracy. Shot Confidence is a new addition, keeping track of the player\u0027s performance on certain courses, for specific puts and using certain clubs. Great performances raise the confidence, which translates into experience and better performance on specific courses. Low confidence leads to lower accuracy, a pumping heartbeat, and rumbling controls on the Wii.\n\nOn the Wii, players can shake the controls to taunt the opponents with 4 different moves, to throw them off. It can be used to influence air conditions, spin, or adds audio distractions. The controls are available in 3 modes: Full Swing (wii remote), Sitting Swing (new, waggle the wii remote) or the classic controls using the nunchuck for analog play. In Full Swing, twisting the wii remote adds hooks and slices prior to shots. Also exclusive to the Wii is a Miniputt mode.",

Formed with great provinces in the north and smaller islands in the south, the region is home to peaceful people who lived in tranquility for many years. The island was once a beautiful place, home to birds and plantations.\n\nThe protagonist is an energetic pink-haired youngster named Tomba (Tombi in Europe). One day, seven evil pigs appeared, and using their magical powers, they mutated the surroundings into a bizarre landscape. The underlings of The Evil Pigs, called the Koma Pigs, stole Tomba\u0027s grandfather\u0027s bracelet and a substantial amount of gold through a strange lust for it.\n\nTomba\u0027s quest is to fetch his bracelet, which requires trapping the Evil Pigs along the way. Trapping them involves finding the Evil Pig Bags, which are keys to entering each realm of each Evil Pig. He must also complete missions for other people to get items and the Evil Pig Bags. Some side-missions are purely for fun and irrelevant to the main storyline.",
    "summary": "Tomba! is a side-scrolling platformer in which players control Tomba, a wild boy on the search for his grandfather\u0027s bangle that was stolen by some evil pigs. Although Tomba is normally restricted to a two-dimensional plane, there are certain points where he can jump or climb onto a new plane. Tomba\u0027s main method of attack is to jump on top of enemies to grab them, allowing him to hop around on them before throwing them away. This can also be used to open other objects such as eggs or treasure chests. Tomba is also able to use various projectile weapons such as maces and boomerangs and can swing on branches and poles.\n\nThe game is based around a mission system, where the main character\u0027s (Tomba\u0027s) skills are employed to complete various tasks. Completion of a mission gives a certain amount of adventure points (AP) which are required for AP boxes which contain food (which gives you AP and restores 1 space of vitality) or items, and you may for example need 50,000 AP to open one. AP is also used to gain access to special places or information later in the game. Not all missions are necessary to progress in the game, however, they are required to achieve full completion. There are 130 events (missions) in the game, many of them rely on other events to be completed.",

A panicking trolley worker reveals that the Evil Pigs kidnapped Tabby when she tried to protect a penchant that was given to her by Tomba as a gift. Gran explains that the Evil Pigs have cursed the entire continent, and gives Tomba a red Pig Bag that is capable of capturing the Flame Pig that has cast his spell on the mines.\n\nTomba ventures throughout the continent gathering the rest of the Pig Bags. He cures the Coal-Mining Town of its inferno by capturing the Evil Flame Pig, cures the Kujara Ranch of its perpetual snowfall by capturing the Evil Ice Pig, cures the Donglin Forest\u0027s gloominess by capturing the Evil Ghost Pig, lifts the Circus Town\u0027s curse (which has turned its citizens into pigs) by capturing the Evil Earth Pig and cures the Water Temple of its perpetual rainfall by capturing the Evil Water Pig. When all of these Evil Pigs have been captured, their leader, the Last Evil Pig, reveals himself to Tomba and tempts him to find his lair. Tomba and Zippo locate the Last Evil Pig in an underground area underneath the Coal-Mining Town, where the Last Evil Pig freezes time in a last-ditch effort to stop Tomba. A final battle against the Last Evil Pig ends with his capture, but he promises his eventual return. Tomba and Zippo find Tabby in the Last Evil Pig\u0027s lair and escape the collapsing area on the back of the flying dog Baron. Following a feast at Tabby\u0027s home, Kainen appears and gives Tomba a monkey suit for him to wear as a reward for going on every adventure possible (if the player completed 133 events, it\u0027ll be black but if they completed those along with the 4 extra events, it\u0027ll be red). Tomba is allowed to pilot the local windmill owner\u0027s new boat to return home. However, Tomba gets involved in an accident on the boat\u0027s maiden voyage.",
    "summary": "Tomba! 2: The Evil Swine Return is a side-scrolling platformer in which the titular character, Tomba, moves on predetermined linear paths until he reaches an intersection point where a flashing arrow appears over his head. At that point Tomba can move in either direction the arrow points. Some areas in the game enable the player to explore them in a top-down view, allowing Tomba to move around freely. The main goal of the game is to complete all 137 objectives (133 make the regular ones, while the other four are obtained from a Tomba 1 save file) which range from retrieving a fishing hook for a fisherman to helping Santa Claus find his \"sack\". Completing a task earns the player \"Adventure Points\", which can be used to unlock specific boxes scattered around the game\u0027s world. As the game progresses, Tomba can obtain suits that give him special abilities. For example, the flying squirrel suit allows Tomba to glide long distances while the pig suit allows Tomba to communicate with friendly pigs. Scattered throughout the levels are magical feathers that can instantly transport Tomba to any area that has previously been visited.",

For example, transforming as Starscream while flying will enable him to fly backwards as a robot to take out enemies behind the protagonist.\n\nFor multiplayer, at any point during a single-player campaign a friend can join in as a \"Remote Weapon System\", which allows them to shoot enemies, erect a shield to defend and transfer energon between both players.",

    "storyline": "From the wikia:\n\"Set two years after the events of Valkyria Chronicles, the story revolves around a civil war within the small Europan nation of Gallia. A rebel group made up of dissatisfied aristocrats and like-minded soldiers and citizens calling themselves the Gallian Revolutionary Army rises up in arms in order to wage an ethnic cleansing campaign against Gallians of Darcsen descent. However, with the intense fight against the Empire having left Gallia\u0027s regular army in an exhausted state, there is initially little to stop the insurrection from gaining momentum. Laws preventing the formation of a national militia to fight fellow Gallians force the government to deploy military academy cadets to the front lines in order to combat and defeat the GRA forces.\"",
    "summary": "Valkyria Chronicles 2 is a sequel to the critically acclaimed tactical RPG Valkyria Chronicles on the PS3, which was released exclusively on the PSP (PlayStation Portable) system. The game takes place two years after the conclusion of the original game and takes you back to the epic adventure set in 1930’s fictitious Europe. In this sequel, you play as a group of young Gallian Military Academy cadets who find themselves plunged into a bitter civil war when the newly formed Gallian Revolutionary Army stages a coup. As the drama and battle unfold, you will experience stories of friendship, love and growing pains during a time of war and revolution.\n\nThe \u0027CANVAS\u0027 engine originally developed by SEGA Game Studios Japan for Valkyria Chronicles has been fully redesigned for the PSP system. This incredibly distinctive engine will power over 20 new distinct and visually stunning environments where you will have over 200 different missions to explore. For the first time ad-hoc Versus and Co-op multiplayer gameplay will now be available. The \u0027BLiTZ\u0027 battle system has also been re-designed to offer players the freedom to strategically move around the environment and attack enemies using real-time controls, something never before seen in the tactical role-playing game genre.\n\nThis game adds some new unit classes and the ability to upgrade or change classes. It also changes the battle system to include multiple map areas that are unlocked as you take over enemy bases revealing more of the battlefield and allowing you to call units into that area.",

    "summary": "The star Vilio has collapsed into a black hole rendering the nearby space mining ships, colony cruisers, and special forces fighters without power. Only the Quarp Jet is capable of a rescue operation because it has the power to teleport. Unfortunately the mission is further complicated by the invasion of a neighboring race. Moreover the ships can only be rescued after disabling their shields. The shields can only be disabled through circuit breakers. The circuit breakers are scattered, and must be deactivated in the correct order. In Velocity the player takes on the role of the Quarp Jet. They must find the station, disable their shields, and rescue the stranded ships. Concurrently they must also battle with the invading race, the Zetachron.\n\nVelocity is a shoot \u0027em up video game developed by FuturLab for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, and PlayStation Vita as a PlayStation mini.\n\nVelocity \u0027​s gameplay involves navigating the Quarp Jet – a teleporting spacecraft – through space, whilst avoiding and defeating enemies using bombs that can be flung in cardinal directions. The main goal of the game is to rescue stranded ships. The game adds depth by introducing new abilities and obstacles. The stranded ships are protected by shields that must be disabled by switches in a specific order. The player\u0027s ship has the ability to fire bombs. The game allows the player to teleport their ship anywhere. It also allows the player create telepods which they can return to anytime. The telepods add a puzzle element to the game because the player has to return to activate the switches in the right order.\n\nThe following review was found at: http://www.deltaattack.com/2012/05/23/review-velocity-psp/\n\nVelocity is hands-down the best PlayStation mini I’ve experienced. Any fan of space-shooters or even of action games in general should strongly consider it.\n\nVelocity took a genre that I had thought done-to-death and revitalized it with highly innovative mechanics. You unlock them as you play through the first half of the game’s 50 levels, and they are:\n\n- Hold R to scroll the screen more quickly. All levels scroll vertically upward, but this lets you increase the scroll speed. Some levels have a short time-limit, requiring you to boost most of the way through.\n\n- Hold Square to move a reticle for teleporting. Used to bypass obstacles, jump over a swarm of enemies, etc.\n\n- Press Circle to launch a bomb in the direction you last moved. Used for destructible obstacles and to decimate static enemies or tight groups of moving enemies.\n\n- Press Triangle to drop a telepod. At any point, you can press L to bring up a map of the level, then move the cursor between telepods, letting you jump back to an earlier part of the level. Necessary when splits occur in a level. Telepods are limited to a certain number per level.\n\nFurther complicating matters are color-coded security systems. Each one generates an instant-death laser field, and can only be disabled by attacking numbered switches in order. Telepods often come in to play with these, requiring you to backtrack in a level in order to trigger switches that you passed up earlier.\n\nThe point of all this is that a star has gone black-hole and is eating up your employer’s mining operations. You must navigate the Quarp Jet through collapsed levels, rescuing miners and scientists stranded in escape capsules. You need to grab a minimum number of capsules in each level.\n\nOne nice feature Velocity has that most space-shooters don’t is that you can run into walls without taking damage. That was an excellent design choice, because with all the speed-scrolling, teleporting, and narrow corridors, the game would be nearly impossible otherwise. Also, your ship has a life meter, so you can take several hits before dying, and you can even refill your health via in-level items.\n\nThe game also has a bumpin’ soundtrack. It’s impressive for a space-shooter in general, let alone a mini. Oddly, it will sometimes cut out between levels, but it’s always there when you’re actually playing.\n\nMy only real complaint about the game, and this is kind of a big one, is that difficulty is forced towards the end. You get experience (XP) based on how well you do in a level, and each level has a minimum XP requirement in order to play it, meaning you will eventually have to go back and play prior levels to get more XP before being able to beat the game. I was disheartened to see this, because otherwise you could make your own difficulty on the fly by being content with Bronze or Silver on a level, but as it is, you’ll have to revisit levels to get Gold and additional XP.\n\nEven with forced-difficulty, this is a stellar title. Between the 50 levels, unlockable missions, a Minesweeper-type game, and the cheat codes and numerous other extra goodies, you’ll get a lot of top-notch entertainment for your money.",

The land came under attack by the Empire of Bronquia, a nation rapidly expanding it\u0027s borders through conquest.

Eventually, King Ordene was overthrown and killed. In the tumult that followed, a girl managed to flee Paltina, the capital of Fantasinia, taking with her nothing but a sword.\n\nThis was the Holy Sword, the Gran Centurio, passed from generation to generation down the royal bloodline. The Legendary blade is said to have been instrumental in founding the Kingdom.\n\nHer name was Yggdra Yuril Artwaltz, and with Fantasinia\u0027s last hope in her hands, she finally reached the southern end of the country. Now, with a small band of allies, the long battle to free her homeland has begun...\"",
