# games-library-react
React-based front-end for Games Library


Technologies used:
* IGDB API (Documentation: https://api-docs.igdb.com)
* MongoDB
* Express
* React
* Node.js
* Postman (used to generate auth-token for API and to query data - responses were saved in JSON format and stored on MongoDB as a workaround solution)
* AWS Proxy API Gateway (set up and functioning, but still had CORS issues within the app; if CORS problem can be resolved, this would be used to access API through the app)
* Heroku
* GitHub (obviously)

Things to fix / improve:
* Make README more detailed (input images and explain step-by-step process)
* Figure out why some consoles (ex: Wii) are not mapping data properly (data appears correct on back-end, but I must have made a mistake somewhere in the code)
* Format page for viewing on mobile devices
* Improve styling and navigation between pages (maybe add a sidebar?)
* Paginate imported data for better loading and easier usage (the console pages right now are just an overload of data)
* Fix Show page for imported game data
* Implement authorization, so my library cannot be editted without permission (or make it so each user can make their own library)
* Figure out a more efficient way of querying data from IGDB API (I brute-forced and worked around problems with API access; if those problems can be solved, the code could be vastly improved)
* Figure out how to use imported data to efficiently add games to user library without manually having to input data
